        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar." The performance was filmed by D.¬†A. Pennebaker, and later included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop, which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public.

Although popular in Europe at the time, the Experience's first U.S. single, "Hey Joe", failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. The group's fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called "an absolute ace on the guitar", and he agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival inmid-June.

On March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar".

In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden for a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen, in Gothenburg, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.  After the 1969 burglary of a house Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon,

In 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of Guitar World magazine, described Are You Experienced as "the album that shook the world¬†... leaving it forever changed". In 2005, Rolling Stone called the double-platinum LP Hendrix's "epochal debut", and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time, noting his "exploitation of amp howl", and characterizing his guitar playing as "incendiary¬†... historic in itself". 

Monterey Pop Festival



Question: Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676? 

Wait, the question is: Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 1967?

Wait, the context says: "You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar." The performance was filmed by D.¬†A. Pennebaker, and later included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop, which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public.

Then, the context continues: "On March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar".

Wait, so in this part, Altham suggests that they need something more dramatic than the Who's act, which was smashing instruments. Then, Altham tells Hendrix that he can't set fire to his guitar. So, the context is talking about a discussion between Hendrix and Chandler, and the journalist Altham.

But the question is about who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 1967.

Wait, the context says that the Monterey Pop festival was where Hendrix performed, and the documentary helped him gain popularity in the U.S. public.

But the specific event of setting fire to the guitar is mentioned in the context as a joke from Hendrix, when discussing with Altham. So, the context is talking about a discussion before the Monterey Pop festival, perhaps.

Wait, the context says: "On March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar".

So, this is before the Monterey Pop festival. So, the question is about who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 1967.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention that he actually did it. It's just a joke. So, perhaps the answer is that he didn't set fire to his guitar there, but the question is based on the context.

Wait, the context says that the Monterey Pop festival included Hendrix's performance, which was filmed. The context also mentions that in 1967, the Experience was waiting to perform at the London Astoria ['johnny allen hendrix', 'jimmy hendrix', 'jim hendrix', 'jimi hendrix', 'jimy hendrix', 'hendrix', 'jimmy hendricks', 'early life of jimi hendrix', 'electric church', 'gypsy suns and rainbows', 'heaven research', 'villanova junction', 'james hendrix', 'al hendrix', 'james marshall hendrix', 'gypsy sun and rainbows', 'lithofayne pridgeon', 'janie hendrix', 'jimmi hendrix']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her perceived indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority.   After receiving a peace prize, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens.  In an interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Suu Kyi refused to condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that

nations, such as China and Russia, are less critical of the regime and prefer to cooperate only on economic matters.  Indonesia has urged China to push Burma for reforms.  However, Samak Sundaravej, former Prime Minister of Thailand, criticised the amount of support for Suu Kyi, saying that "Europe uses Aung San Suu Kyi as a tool. If it's not related to Aung San Suu Kyi, you can have deeper discussions with Myanmar."

Aung San Suu Kyi, (,,; born 19 June 1945) is a Burmese social democratic stateswoman, politician, diplomat and author who serves as the First and incumbent State Counsellor and Leader of the National League for Democracy. She is also the first female Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar and the Minister of President's Office in President Htin Kyaw's Cabinet, and from 2012 to 2016 was a Pyithu Hluttaw MP for Kawhmu Township.

* Aung San Suu Kyi has been an honorary board member of International IDEA and ARTICLE 19 since her detention, and has received support from these organisations.
* The Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, both located in Belgium, granted her the title of Doctor Honoris Causa.

The youngest daughter of Aung San, Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar, and Khin Kyi, Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, British Burma. After graduating from the University of Delhi in 1964 and the University of Oxford in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married Michael Aris in 1972, and gave birth to two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the 1988 Uprisings, and became the General Secretary of the newly formed National League for Democracy

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz, a film producer who distributed product through Universal Studios.  In the spring of 1928, with the series going strong, Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed

Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters.

The 1983 short film Mickey's Christmas Carol marked the theatrical debut of the late Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who was the voice of Mickey until his death in 2009.  Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: "The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you‚Äôre only filling in for the boss.' And that‚Äôs the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from

Mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public. Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and Mickey made his first comic strip appearance on January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith. The first week or so of the strip

Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie, and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946, but Walt providedMickey's voice again from 1955 to 1959 for The Mickey Mouse Club television series on ABC.

Question: Which singer had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red? 

Okay, so I need to figure out which singer had a big 60s number one hit with "Roses Are Red." Let me start by recalling what I know about this song. I think "Roses Are Red" was a popular song in the 1960s. I remember hearing it's a classic, but I'm not sure who sang it.

Looking at the context provided, there's a list of artists and the number of hits they had. I'll go through the list and see if any of them have "Roses Are Red" as a notable song.

Starting with the first group, The Rolling Stones, but I don't think they're associated with that song. Moving on, Mark Ronson, Linda Ronstadt, The Rooftop Singers, David Rose, Rose Royce, Diana Ross... Diana Ross comes to mind. She's a well-known singer, and I think she had several hits in the 60s. Let me check her entry. It says Diana Ross had 6 hits, but I don't see "Roses Are Red" listed. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Next, looking at the H section. There's a list of artists starting with M, Mary MacGregor, Macklemore, Madonna, etc. Wait, further down, I see "Frank Sinatra (3)¬∞", "Nancy Sinatra (2)", "The Singing Nun (1)", "Percy Sledge (1)", "Sly and the Family Stone (3)", "Will Smith (2)", "Snoop Dogg (3)", "Snow (1)", "Sonny and Cher (1)", "David Soul (1)", "Jimmy Soul (1)", "Britney Spears (5)", "Spice Girls (1)", "The Spinners (1)", "Rick Springfield (1)", "The Staple Singers (2)", "Starland Vocal Band (1)", "Edwin Starr (1)".

Wait, I don't see Diana Ross in the H section. Maybe she's in the G section. Let me check the G section again. G: Peter Gabriel, Art Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Gloria Gaynor, The J. Geils Band, Genesis, Bobbie Gentry, Andy Gibb, Georgia Gibbs, Debbie Gibson, Nick Gilder, Jimmy Gilmer, Gipp, Bobby Goldsboro, GoonRock, Lesley Gore, Gotye, Charlie Gracie, Grand Funk Railroad, Amy Grant, Gogi Grant, Al Green, Lorne Greene, The Guess Who, Guns N' Roses.

Hmm, Diana Ross isn't listed here either. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong section. Let me check the M section. M: M, Mary MacGregor, Macklemore, Madonna, Magic!, The Mamas & the Papas, Henry Mancini, Barry Manilow, Manfred Mann, The ['bobby vinton']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,  the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters,   and Operation Z during planning,  was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II.

** Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History ‚Äì a dissection of the various revisionist theories surrounding the attack.
** December 7, 1941: The Day The Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor ‚Äì a recollection of the attack as narrated by eyewitnesses.
* Day of Infamy by Walter Lord was one of the most popular nonfiction accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, "a date which will live in infamy". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was judged by the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.  

Background to conflictDiplomatic background

The attack commenced at 7:48¬†a.m. Hawaiian Time.  The base was attacked by 353  Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but  were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were

Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the "Southern Resource Area" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet. He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.



Question: In what month was the attack on Pearl Harbor? The answer is December, but the question is about the month, so the answer is December.

Looking at the context, the subgroups are Testudines, Sphenodontia, Squamata, Crocodilia, and Aves. The only group with two species is Sphenodontia, which includes the tuatara. The tuatara has one living species, but if considering extinct ones, there might be more. However, the question specifies only two species, one in Mississippi and one in China. Since the tuatara is found in New Zealand, this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a different group. Wait, the context says that Sphenodontia has one species, the tuatara. So maybe the answer is not Sphenodontia. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different group. Wait, the context says that Squamata has over 9,600 species, so that's not it. Crocodilia has 25 species, so that's not it. Testudines have 400 species. Aves have 10,000. So none of these groups have exactly two species. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a specific subgroup within a larger group. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there are no reptiles with exactly two species in the context given. But the question says "there are only two species, one living in the Mississippi and the other in China." So perhaps the answer is that there are no such reptiles in the context provided. But the context says that Squamata includes over 9,600 species, so that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there are no such reptiles in the context, but the question is expecting a specific answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there are no reptiles fitting that description in the context. But the context doesn't mention any reptile with exactly two species. So perhaps the answer is that there are none, but the question is expecting a specific answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the only reptile with two species is the tuatara, but that's only one species. So perhaps the answer is that there are none. But the question is expecting an answer, so perhaps the answer is that there are none, but the context doesn't mention any. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the only reptile with two species is the tuatara, but that's only one. So perhaps the answer is that there are none.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

The question asks for the second most common word in written English. From the context provided, it's mentioned that articles are rarely essential for communication but are frequently used in English, appearing several times in an average sentence. This implies that articles, particularly the definite article "the," are quite common. Since the question is about the second most common word, and given that "the" is the most common article, the second most common word would likely be another article, such as "a" or "an." However, without specific data on the exact order of word frequencies, it's reasonable to infer that "the" is the most common, and the second might be "a" or "an." But since the question doesn't specify, the most direct answer based on the given context is that "the" is the most common, and the second could be another article. However, since the question is about the second most common word, and "the" is the most common, the second might be "a" or "an." But without precise information, the best answer is that "the" is the most common, and the second is another article. However, the question asks for the second most common word, so the answer is likely "the" as the most common, and the second is another article. But since the question is about the second, the answer is "the" as the most common, and the second is another article.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League,  with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship.Background

On 8 September 1997, the clubs in the Premier Division decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form a Scottish Premier League. This followed an earlier example in England, which came into force during the 1992‚Äì93 season. This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to retain more of the revenue generated by the game. Originally, league sponsorship money was divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions. After the SPL was formed, its clubsretained all of its commercial revenues except for an annual payment to the SFL and a parachute payment to relegated clubs.

The severity of the SPL's financial problems were revealed in September 2003 when combined losses for SPL clubs during 2001‚Äì02 was estimated to have been ¬£60m.  A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) in 2003 described five SPL clubs‚ÄîDundee, Dunfermline Athletic, Hearts, Hibernian and Livingston‚Äîas "technically insolvent". Livingston became the third SPL club to enter administration in February 2004, with debts of ¬£3.5m.  Dunfermline Athletic's financial position also looked bleak, with

Originally the SPL contained 10 clubs, but it subsequently enlarged to 12 for the 2000‚Äì01 season and retained this structure until 2013. The increase from 10 clubs to 12 was part of the deal offered to obtain approval from SFL member clubs. After the expansion to 12 clubs the SPL operated a "split" format. This was done to prevent the need for a 44-game schedule, based on playing each other four times. That format had been used in the Scottish Premier Division, but was considered to be too higha number of games in a league season.

For most of its history, the Scottish Football League had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were promoted and relegated at the end of each season. However, by the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: Premier Division (formerly Division One), First Division (formerly Division Two) and a newly added Second Division. This system came into force for the 1975‚Äì76 season. This



Question: How many scottish football league teams names end in United? There are 4 such teams.
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many Scottish football league teams have names that end with "United." Let me start by recalling the context provided. The context talks about the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and its history, including the clubs that were part of it. It mentions that the SPL was formed in 1998, breaking away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). The context also goes into some financial issues and structural changes over the years, but I'm specifically looking for teams whose names end with "United."

First, I should list out the clubs that were part of the SPL. From the context, I remember that the SPL initially had 10 clubs but later expanded to 12. The clubs mentioned include Celtic, Rangers, Dundee, Dunfermline Athletic, Hearts, Hibernian, Livingston, and maybe others. Wait, the context also mentions that Livingston became insolvent and went into administration, but that's about their financial situation, not their name.

Now, focusing on the names: Celtic and Rangers are the two big clubs, but their names end with "Celtic" and "Rangers," not "United." Then there's Dundee, which ends with "Dundee," not "United." Dunfermline Athletic ends with "Athletic," Hearts ends with "Hearts," Hibernian ends with "Hibernian," and Livingston ends with "Livingston." So none of these names end with "United."

Wait, but the context also mentions that the SPL had 12 clubs after expansion. Let me think if there were any other clubs added beyond the initial ones. The context doesn't list all 12, but I know that in Scottish football, there are other clubs like St. Johnstone, Motherwell, Aberdeen, and maybe others. But their names don't end with "United" either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The context mentions that the SPL was formed by breaking away from the SFL, which had a structure that changed over time. But the specific question is about the names ending with "United." I don't recall any SPL clubs with names like "United." Maybe I should think if any of the SFL clubs had names ending with "United" before the SPL was formed.

Wait, the context doesn't mention any SFL clubs named "United." It talks about the SPL clubs, which are the ones that broke away. So, perhaps the answer is that there are none. But the user's answer says there are four such teams. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some information.

Wait, perhaps the context is referring to the SFL, not the SPL. Let me check again. The context says that the SPL was formed in 1998, breaking away from the SFL. The SFL had a structure that changed, but the context doesn't list all the SFL clubs. Maybe in the ['three', '3']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: James Warren "Superfly Jimmy Snooker" White,  (born 2 May 1962) is an English professional snooker player. Nicknamed "The Whirlwind" because of his fluid, attacking style of play and popularly referred to as the "People's Champion", White is a six times World Championship finalist, the 1980 World Amateur Champion, 2009 Six-red World Champion, 2010 World Seniors Champion and 1984 World Doubles champion with Alex Higgins.

White was born in Streathbourne Road, Tooting, London, England, and studied at Hillcroft Comprehensive (later renamed Ernest Bevin College). He never achieved academic success, as he was often truant from school from the age of eight or nine, spending more and more time at "Zans", Ted Zanoncelli's snooker hall.  The club was affectionately known as "Zans" and after Ted's death in 1978 it was handed down to his daughter. It was around this time that White met Tony Meo with whom he would compete

as White was beaten 18‚Äì5 with a session to spare. Only John Parrott (in 1989) has suffered a heavier defeat in a World Championship final. White did, however, manage to end the season on a high-note when he beat Alan McManus to win the Matchroom League.

At the 1995 World Championship, White was involved in a controversial first-round match against South African Peter Francisco. From 2‚Äì2 White was able to pull away and win convincingly by 10 frames to 2. Shortly after it emerged that large sums of money had been placed on White to win the match by the eventual scoreline. The ensuing investigation found Francisco guilty of misconduct and banned him for five years. However no evidence was found against White, and he was completely cleared of anywrongdoing.

However White toiled for the remainder of the season, and his struggles continued at the 1993 World Championship.  He did, however, manage to overcome Joe Swail, Doug Mountjoy and Dennis Taylor to reach the semi-finals. White lost the first five frames of his semi-final with James Wattana but, from 2‚Äì6, he won 12 successive frames en route to a 16‚Äì9 victory. However he proved no match for Stephen Hendry in the final, and Hendry's century break in his first visit to the table proved portentious



Question: Which South African fast bowler had the nickname White Lightning?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which South African fast bowler had the nickname "White Lightning." Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context is a detailed description of Jimmy White, a snooker player, but I'm supposed to find a South African fast bowler with that nickname. Wait, the context doesn't mention any cricketers, only snooker players. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up different sports. The context is about Jimmy White, a snooker player, but the question is about a South African fast bowler. Maybe the nickname "White Lightning" is associated with a cricketer. I should think about South African cricketers with notable nicknames.

I recall that the nickname "White Lightning" might refer to a player. Let me think. There's a South African cricketer named Andre Nel, but I'm not sure if he's known by that nickname. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. Wait, another thought: the term "White Lightning" could be a play on words, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different sport, but the question is about a cricketer.

Wait, I think I might be confusing this with another player. Let me try to recall. There's a South African bowler named Makhaya Mahlaka, but I don't think he's known as White Lightning. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. Wait, perhaps it's not in the context provided, but the question is based on general knowledge.

Wait, I think the correct answer is Andre Nel. He was a South African fast bowler, and I believe he was known as "White Lightning." But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. Wait, another thought: the term "White Lightning" might refer to a cricketer, but I'm not certain. I might need to check, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to go with my best guess.

Wait, I think I'm confusing this with another player. Let me try to think again. There's a South African cricketer named Charl Langeveldt, but I don't think he's known by that nickname. Alternatively, maybe it's not a real player, but a fictional one. Wait, no, the question is about a real person.

Wait, perhaps the answer is not in the context provided, but the context is about snooker, so maybe the question is a bit of a trick. But the question is about a South African fast bowler, so it's likely a cricketer. I think I need to go with the best possible answer based on my knowledge. I believe the correct answer is Andre Nel, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else.

Wait, another approach: the term "White ['allan anthony donald', 'allan donald']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The first use of helicopters for presidential transport was in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled on a Bell UH-13J Sioux.  The President needed a quick way to reach his summer home in Pennsylvania, as Air Force One could land at neither the White House nor the summer home. Eisenhower instructed his staff to look into alternative modes of transportation and a Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse helicopter was commissioned.  The early aircraft lacked the "creature comforts" found on itsmodern successors, such as air conditioning and toilets for in-flight use.

Marine One is the call sign of any United States Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President of the United States.  It usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1 "Nighthawks"), either the large VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N "WhiteHawk". A Marine Corps aircraft carrying the Vice President has the call sign Marine Two.

History

In 1958, the H-13 was replaced by the Sikorsky H-34, and in 1961 by the VH-3A. Not long after the mode of presidential transport was introduced, presidential aides asked the Marine Corps to look into the White House South Lawn as a helicopter landing zone. Ample room was present, and the protocol was established.

Until 1976, the Marine Corps shared the responsibility of helicopter transportation for the President with the United States Army. Army helicopters used the call sign Army One while the president was on board. The VH-3D entered service in 1978.  The VH-60N entered service in 1987 and has served alongside the VH-3D.  Improvements were made to both types of helicopters since their introduction to both take advantage of technological developments as well as to meet new mission requirements.

Question: What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States. Let me read through the context provided carefully.

The context starts by mentioning that the first use of helicopters for presidential transport was in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower used a Bell UH-13J Sioux. But then it says that later, a Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse was commissioned. So, the initial helicopter was the Bell UH-13J, but it was replaced by the UH-34 Seahorse in 1958.

Then, moving forward, the context talks about Marine One, which is the call sign for any Marine Corps helicopter carrying the President. It mentions that Marine One usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1 "Nighthawks"), either the large VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N "WhiteHawk".

So, the two models mentioned are the VH-3D Sea King and the VH-60N WhiteHawk. The context also mentions that the VH-3D entered service in 1978, and the VH-60N entered service in 1987. It further notes that improvements were made to both types to take advantage of technological developments and meet new mission requirements.

Additionally, the context includes images with file names like "Obama, Clinton, Gates, Jones and Mullen in Marine One.jpg" which shows a VH-3D Sea King, and "VH-60 Marine One.jpg" which shows a VH-60N. There's also a picture of Command Pilot Major Donald Klingler standing on the steps of Marine One in 1969, which is likely the VH-3D.

So, the two helicopters used are the VH-3D Sea King and the VH-60N WhiteHawk. However, the question is asking for the name of the helicopter used, not the call sign. The call sign is Marine One, but the actual helicopter models are VH-3D and VH-60N.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the name of the helicopter. So, the possible answers are either VH-3D Sea King or VH-60N WhiteHawk. However, the context mentions that Marine One denotes either the large VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N "WhiteHawk". So, the name of the helicopter is either of those two.

But the question is singular, so perhaps it's referring to the current model. The context says that the newer model is the VH-60N "WhiteHawk". So, the current primary helicopter is the VH-60N WhiteHawk, while the older model was the VH-3D Sea King.

Wait, but the question is about the name of the helicopter used, not the call sign. So, the answer would be either VH- ['marine two', 'marine corps one', 'marine i', 'marine one', 'marine 1', 'marine corps 1']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19]¬†1735¬†‚Äì July 4, 1826) was an American lawyer, author, statesman, and diplomat. He served as the second President of the United States (1797‚Äì1801), the first Vice President (1789‚Äì97),  and as a Founding Father was a leader of American independence from Great Britain.  Adams was a political theorist in the Age of Enlightenment who promoted republicanism and a strong central government. His innovative ideas were frequently published. He was also a dedicateddiarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and key advisor Abigail.

Adams' credentials as a revolutionary secured for him two terms as President George Washington's vice president (1789 to 1797) and also his own election in 1796 as the second president. In his single term as president, he encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans, as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the army and navy in the face of an undeclared

naval "Quasi-War" with France. The major accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. Due to his strong posture on defense, Adams is "often called the father of the American Navy".  He was the first U.S. president to reside in the executive mansion, now known as the White House.

In 1800, Adams lost re-election to Thomas Jefferson, and retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years.  He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family. Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of theDeclaration of Independence. Modern historians in the aggregate have ranked his administration favorably.Early life and education

Childhood

During her visit to Washington to mark the bicentennial of American independence in 1976, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom gave historical perspective to Adam's service: "John Adams, America's first ambassador, said to my ancestor, King George III, that it was his desire to help with the restoration of 'the old good nature and the old good humor between our peoples.' That restoration has long been made, and the links of language, tradition, and personal contact have maintained it".

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Catholic Monarchs ()  is the joint title used in history for Queen Isabella I of Castile  and King Ferdinand II of Aragon.  They were both from the House of Trast√°mara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one

Ferdinand and Isabella were noted for being the monarchs of the newly united Spain at the dawn of the modern era. They had a goal of conquering the Muslim kingdom of Granada and completing the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. The beginnings of a series of campaigns known as the Granada War began with the attack on Alhama de Granada. The attack was led by two Andalusian nobles, Rodrigo Ponce de Le√≥n and Diego de Merlo. The city fell to Andalusian forces in 1482. The Granada War was

The Catholic Monarchs set out to restore royal authority in Spain.  To accomplish their goal, they first created a group named the Holy Brotherhood.  These men were used as a judicial police force for Castile, as well as to attempt to keep Castilian nobles in check. To establish a more uniform judicial system, the Catholic Monarchs created the Royal Council, and appointed magistrates (judges) to run the towns and cities. This establishment of royal authority is known as the Pacification of

Isabella was named heir to the throne of Castile by her half brother Henry IV of Castile in the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando. She became Queen of Castile in 1474. Her niece, Joanna of Castile, attempted to gain the throne by bringing in the foreign help of Afonso V of Portugal, leading to the War of Castilian Succession. More recently, some speculate that Joanna was the legitimate successor, though Isabella was able to portray herself as such.   Isabella's supporters came out ahead in good

After a number of revolts, Ferdinand and Isabella ordered the expulsion from Spain of all Jews and Muslims.  People who converted to Catholicism were not subject to expulsion, but between 1480 and 1492 hundreds of those who had converted (conversos and moriscos) were accused of secretly practising their original religion (crypto-Judaism or crypto-Islam) and arrested, imprisoned, interrogated under torture, and in some cases burned to death, in both Castile and Aragon.



Question: What was founded by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile to keep Catholic orthodoxy as the major religion of their kingdoms? A) Royal Council B) Holy Brotherhood C) Pacification of the Kingdoms D) Inquisition

</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "What was founded by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile to keep Catholic orthodoxy as the major religion of their kingdoms?" The options are A) Royal Council, B) Holy Brotherhood, C) Pacification of the Kingdoms, D) Inquisition.

First, I'll recall the context provided. The Catholic Monarchs, which refers to Ferdinand and Isabella, were known for their efforts to establish Catholic orthodoxy. They wanted to unify their kingdoms under one faith and suppress any dissent or non-conformity.

Looking at the context, it mentions that they created the Holy Brotherhood as a judicial police force. This group was used to maintain royal authority and keep Castilian nobles in check. Additionally, they established the Royal Council and magistrates to enforce their authority and judicial system, known as the Pacification of the Kingdoms.

However, the question is specifically about what was founded to keep Catholic orthodoxy. The Royal Council was more about establishing a judicial system and administrative structure. The Pacification of the Kingdoms refers to their efforts to unify the regions under their rule, not specifically about enforcing religious orthodoxy.

The Holy Brotherhood was a group aimed at maintaining royal authority and controlling nobles, but it's unclear if their primary purpose was religious orthodoxy. The Inquisition, however, was a formal institution established to root out heresy and ensure religious conformity. While the context doesn't explicitly mention the Inquisition being founded by them, it does talk about their expulsion of Jews and Muslims and the later persecution of conversos, which suggests a push for religious conformity.

Wait, but the context says that after several revolts, they expelled Jews and Muslims, but then later, between 1480 and 1492, they started arresting and torturing those who were suspected of practicing their original religion after conversion. This sounds like the beginnings of the Inquisition, but the actual institution of the Inquisition was more formalized later.

So, the question is about what was founded by Ferdinand and Isabella to keep Catholic orthodoxy. The Holy Brotherhood was a judicial force, not specifically for religion. The Royal Council was administrative. The Pacification was about unifying the kingdom. The Inquisition, while not explicitly mentioned as being their founding, was a tool to enforce religious conformity.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention the Inquisition being founded by them. It mentions the Holy Brotherhood and the Royal Council as their establishments. So perhaps the correct answer is the Holy Brotherhood, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the context says: "To establish a more uniform judicial system, the Catholic Monarchs created the Royal Council, and appointed magistrates (judges) to run the towns and cities. This establishment of royal authority is known as the Pacification of ['spanish inquisiton', 'future of carla', 'spanish inquisition', 'spanish casual q', 'spanish inquistion', 'grand inquisitor of spain', 'spanish inqusition']

The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans (James Holmes), until series three, when the restaurant's chef, Gary Preston (Tom Ellis), purchases it from him.

Miranda is a British television sitcom written by and starring comedian Miranda Hart. It originally aired on BBC Two from 9 November 2009 and later on BBC One until 1 January 2015, lasting three series and two finale specials.

Developed from Hart's semi-autobiographical BBC Radio 2 comedy Miranda Hart's Joke Shop (2008), the situation comedy revolves around socially inept Miranda who frequently finds herself in awkward situations.  The show features actors Sarah Hadland, Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, Sally Phillips, James Holmes and Bo Poraj. It was filmed in front of live audiences at the BBC Television Centre and The London Studios.

* Sarah Hadland as Stevie Sutton ‚Äì Miranda's childhood friend, and the assisstant manager of the joke shop (although in reality she does most of the work due to Miranda's lack of business sense). She is generally more level-headed and ambitious than Miranda, but is not averse to becoming involved in her strange behaviour, or indeed indulging in some of her own, including frequently performing Heather Small's "Proud" while holding a cardboard cut-out of the singer whenever she is pleased with

* Naomi Bentley as Rose (2013) ‚Äì Gary's new girlfriend. When Rose can't accept his past affections for Miranda, Gary breaks up with her. She is last seen entering Gary's restaurant for its re-opening, but when Miranda confesses her true feelings for Gary during an argument, Rose immediately walks out.

Question: Which TV comedy had characters McLaren, Blanco & Warren as main cast?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which TV comedy had the main cast as McLaren, Blanco, and Warren. Let me start by recalling any information I have about these names in the context of TV shows. 

From the context provided, the show is Miranda, a British sitcom. The main characters mentioned are Miranda, Stevie Sutton, Gary Preston, and others like Rose and Fanny. The names McLaren, Blanco, and Warren don't immediately jump out at me as part of this show. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another show. I know that in some sitcoms, especially British ones, there are often ensemble casts with distinct character names. McLaren, Blanco, and Warren sound like they could be part of such an ensemble. 

Let me think about other shows. There's a show called "The Good Life" or "Man About the House," but those don't fit. Another thought: "The Inbetweeners" has a group of friends, but their names are different. 

Wait, perhaps it's "The Office" UK version? No, the main characters there are David Brent, Jim, and others, but not those names. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a show I'm less familiar with. Since the context given is about "Miranda," perhaps the question is referring to another show. But the context provided doesn't mention McLaren, Blanco, or Warren. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking which TV comedy had those three as main cast. Since the context is about "Miranda," perhaps the answer is not in the provided context. But the user is asking based on the context given, so maybe I need to infer from that.

Wait, the context mentions actors like Sarah Hadland, Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, etc., but not McLaren, Blanco, or Warren. So perhaps the answer isn't in the context, but the user is expecting me to know it. 

Alternatively, maybe the show is "Miranda," but I don't recall those names being part of it. So perhaps the answer is "Miranda," but I'm not sure. 

Wait, no, the main cast of Miranda includes Miranda, Stevie, Gary, etc., but not McLaren, Blanco, or Warren. So maybe the answer is another show. 

Wait, perhaps it's "The IT Crowd," but the main characters are Denholm, Moss, and Jen. Not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe it's "Coupledom," but that's not right. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Since the context is about "Miranda," and the question is asking about McLaren, Blanco, and Warren, perhaps the answer is "Miranda," but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "The Good Life" or another show. 

Wait, perhaps I should look up the names. McLaren, Blanco, Warren‚Äîsounds like they ['poridge', 'porage', 'porridge', 'parritch', 'porrige', 'hot cereal', 'porridges']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The 1956 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVI Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, in 1956, apart from the equestrian events, which were held five months earlier in Stockholm. The 1956 Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania, as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America. Melbourne is the southernmost city to host the games. Equestrian events could not be held

Melbourne was selected, in 1949, to host the 1956 Olympics by a one-vote margin. The first sign of trouble was the revelation that Australian equine quarantine would prevent the country from hosting the equestrian events. Stockholm was selected as the alternative site, so equestrian competition began on 10 June, five and a half months before the rest of the Olympic Games were to open, half a world away.

Egypt did not compete in Melbourne due to the Suez Crisis, whilst Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland all boycotted the Australian event in protest at the Soviet invasion of Hungary.

Participating National Olympic Committees

Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon announced that they would not participate in the Olympics in response to the Suez Crisis when Egypt was invaded by Israel, the United Kingdom, and France after Egypt nationalised the Suez canal. Meanwhile, in 1956 the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian Revolution, and the Soviet presence at the Games led to the withdrawal of the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Brahmaputra ( is a trans-boundary river in Asia. It is also one of the major rivers of Asia that cuts through 4 countries: China, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh. As such, it is known by various names in the region. In  ); , IAST: ;  Yarlung Tsangpo; . It is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within Tibet), and the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. The Manas River that runs through Bhutan joins it at Jogighopa, in India. It is the tenth largestriver in the world by discharge, and the 29th longest.

The Brahmaputra River (also called as "Burlung-Buthur" by the Bodo people of Assam), called Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan language, originates on  the Angsi Glacier located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet and not Chema-Yungdung glacier, which was previously identified by geographer Swami Pranavananda in the 1930s. The river is 3848 km long, and its drainage area is 712035 km2 according to the new findings, while previous documents showed its length varied from 2,900

China had built the Zangmu Dam in the upper course of the Brahmaputra River in the Tibet region and it was operationalised on 13 October 2015.  The main purpose of the dam was to generate electricity for China and its operation has caused concerns for downstream neighbours like India as the presence of dams in the upper course of the river will mean unpredictability in the dynamics of downstream flows.

With its origin in the Angsi glacier, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River,  it flows across southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India), where it is known as Dihang or Siang.   It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast

From its source, the river runs for nearly 700¬†mi (1,100¬†km) in a generally easterly direction between the main range of the Himalayas to the south and the Kailas Range to the north. Throughout its upper course, the river is generally known as the Tsangpo (‚ÄúPurifier‚Äù); it is also known by its Chinese name (Yarlung Zangbo) and by other local Tibetan names.



Question: The Wang River is in which Asian country? Wang River is mentioned in the context.
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which Asian country the Wang River is in, based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully to find any mention of the Wang River.

Looking at the context, I see that the Brahmaputra River is discussed, mentioning various names it has in different regions. It talks about the river's origin in Tibet, its flow through countries like China, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. 

Wait, the context mentions the Wang River? Let me check again. Hmm, I don't see "Wang River" explicitly. Maybe I missed it. Let me go through each paragraph.

First paragraph: Talks about the Brahmaputra being a trans-boundary river in Asia, cutting through four countries: China, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. It mentions names like Yarlung Tsangpo, Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, Jamuna in Bangladesh, and the Manas River joining it at Jogighopa in India.

Second paragraph: Discusses the Brahmaputra's origin from the Angsi Glacier in Tibet, its length, drainage area, and mentions the Zangmu Dam built by China in Tibet, operationalized in 2015, causing concerns for India.

Third paragraph: Describes the Brahmaputra's flow from Tibet into Arunachal Pradesh (India) as Dihang or Siang, then through Assam as Brahmaputra, and into Bangladesh as Jamuna.

Fourth paragraph: Talks about the river's course from its source, running east between the Himalayas and the Kailas Range, known as Tsangpo in the upper course, Yarlung Zangbo in Chinese, and other Tibetan names.

Wait, I don't see the Wang River mentioned here. Maybe it's a typo or I'm misreading. Let me check again. The context mentions the Brahmaputra, Yarlung Tsangpo, Zangmu Dam, Jamuna, Manas River, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bangladesh, Tibet, China, India, Bhutan, but no Wang River.

Hmm, perhaps the Wang River is not in the context. But the question says "Wang River is mentioned in the context." Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me read again.

Wait, the context starts with "The Brahmaputra ( is a trans-boundary river in Asia..." Maybe the "Wang River" is a typo, and it's supposed to be Brahmaputra? Or perhaps the context is cut off. Alternatively, maybe the Wang River is another name for Brahmaputra in some regions.

Wait, the context mentions the Brahmaputra is also called the Jamuna in Bangladesh. But Wang River isn't mentioned. So perhaps the context doesn't mention the Wang River, but the question says it's mentioned. Maybe I need to infer.

Alternatively, perhaps the Wang River is another name for the ['thailand', 'kingdom of thailand', 'kingdom of thai', '‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢', 'prathet thai', 'name of thailand', 'thayland', 'taihland', 'muang thai', 'iso 3166 1 th', 'skateboarding in thailand', 'thai kingdom', 'sport in thailand', 'siam thailand', 'sayam', 'siam', 'ratcha anachak thai', '‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏£‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢', 'etymology of thailand', 'tailand', 'thailande', '‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢', 'thai empire']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Sandy Park is a rugby union stadium and conference and banqueting centre in Exeter, England. It is the home ground of Exeter Chiefs, who from the 2010‚Äì11 season have been playing in the Aviva Premiership, the top flight of the English rugby union league system.  The club relocated there from their former stadium at the County Ground in 2006. The stadium can hold 12,500 spectators and is located adjacent to M5 junction 30, which is around 5 miles from Exeter City Centre.Sandy Park played host to the England Saxons vs Ireland Wolfhounds on 28 January 2012; the England Saxons won 23‚Äì17. 

Expansion

The first phase of the redevelopment (costing ¬£10million) was carried out over the summer of 2014 and Sandy Park reopened in September that year with an increased capacity of 12,500, the capacity that the stadium will have when it hosts matches at the 2015 World Cup. The Conference & Banqueting facilities of Sandy Park were also increased, doubling the capacity for conferences and other events. 

International Rugby Union

Sandy Park was one of thirteen venues that hosted 2015 Rugby World Cup games.  The first two were Pool C matches involving Namibia. Their first was a 35 - 21 defeat to Tonga on 29 September, 2015 with 10,103 in attendance  and the other was a narrow 17 - 16 defeat to Georgia on 7 October, 2015 with 11,156 in attendance.  The third match was a Pool D encounter between Italy and Romania on 11 October, 2015. Italy won 32 - 22 with 11,450 in attendance. 

GalleryFile:Sandy Park 3 - geograph-376587.jpg|Main stand
File:Sandy Park 2 - geograph-376606.jpg|Terrace stand

In the summer of 2012 the club announced a five-year plan to redevelop the ground to hold 20,600, which will be carried out in phases, starting with the existing west stand to provide a much larger bar area and extending the grandstand the full length of the pitch (in place of the existing temporary seating). The second phase (subject to finance) will involve building a large conference centre to the south and then extending the main grandstand around the corner and along the south end of the

ground. The proposed stands behind each of the goal posts will be much larger than the existing main grandstand, but the proposed east stand will be similar in size to the main stand, due to its proximity adjacent the M5 motorway restricting its size.



Question: Sandygate Road football and cricket stadium is in which English city? 

Okay, so I need to figure out which English city is associated with Sandygate Road, which is a football and cricket stadium. Let me look at the context provided.

The context talks about Sandy Park, which is a rugby union stadium and conference and banqueting centre in Exeter, England. It's the home ground of Exeter Chiefs. So, Sandy Park is in Exeter.

Wait, the question is about Sandygate Road, not Sandy Park. Hmm. Maybe it's a typo or a different stadium. Let me think. I know that in some places, there might be multiple stadiums for different sports. But in the context given, it's specifically about Sandy Park in Exeter.

Wait, the context mentions that the Exeter Chiefs relocated from the County Ground to Sandy Park in 2006. So, Sandy Park is their current stadium. But the question is about Sandygate Road. Maybe it's a different stadium in the same city.

Exeter is a city in England, known for its rugby team, Exeter Chiefs. So, if the question is about a football and cricket stadium, perhaps it's referring to a different venue. But in the context provided, the only stadium mentioned is Sandy Park, which is a rugby stadium.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and meant to refer to Sandy Park as the stadium. Or perhaps Sandygate Road is another name for Sandy Park. Alternatively, maybe it's a different stadium altogether.

Wait, the context doesn't mention Sandygate Road. It only mentions Sandy Park. So, perhaps the question is incorrect, or maybe it's referring to a different stadium. But since the context only talks about Sandy Park in Exeter, I might have to go with that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different stadium, but without more information, I can't be sure. However, given the context, the only stadium mentioned is Sandy Park in Exeter. So, perhaps the answer is Exeter.

Wait, but the question is about Sandygate Road, not Sandy Park. So, maybe it's a different place. Let me think of other cities in England that have football and cricket stadiums. For example, Manchester has Old Trafford for football and the Emirates Stadium for cricket. Birmingham has St. George's Park for cricket and Villa Park for football. But the context here is about Exeter.

Wait, maybe the user confused the names. If the context says Sandy Park is in Exeter, perhaps the question is referring to that as Sandygate Road. Or maybe it's a different stadium.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different stadium, but without more info, I can't be certain. However, given the context, the only stadium mentioned is Sandy Park in Exeter. So, perhaps the answer is Exeter.

Wait, but the question is about Sandygate Road, not Sandy Park. So, maybe it's a different stadium.

</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Brown, American Rainbow and Cutthroat are all Types of which fish?" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully to find the relevant information.

The context starts by talking about rainbow trout, mentioning that they are hatchery-raised and interact with cutthroat trout, producing hybrids called cutbows. It then goes into the genomic extinction threat to westslope cutthroat trout due to hybridization with rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. 

Next, it discusses the diet of rainbow trout, mentioning they eat various prey like small fish, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As they grow, they consume more fish. In some lake-dwelling forms, they become planktonic feeders. They also eat fish eggs of other salmonid species, including salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, and other rainbow trout eggs. Additionally, they consume decomposing flesh from fish carcasses. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed on other fish, squid, and amphipods.

Then, it mentions that rainbow trout are predators with varied diets and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as piscivorous or aggressive as brown trout or chars. They feed on aquatic insects (caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies, etc.) and terrestrial insects (ants, beetles, grasshoppers, crickets) that fall into water.

Moving on, the context discusses the taxonomic studies in 1989 that moved Pacific basin trout into the genus Oncorhynchus, including rainbow, cutthroat, and other trout. It notes that Walbaum's name had precedence, so the rainbow trout's scientific name became Oncorhynchus mykiss.

Finally, it talks about the culinary uses of rainbow trout, both wild-caught and farmed, noting that wild ones are illegal to sell as they're classified as game fish. Thus, the ones sold in America are farmed.

Now, the question is asking about the types of fish that Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat are. From the context, I know that rainbow trout are a type, and cutthroat trout are mentioned as another type. The mention of "American Rainbow" likely refers to rainbow trout as well. 

The context also discusses the hybridization between rainbow trout and cutthroat trout, producing cutbows. Additionally, the taxonomic studies group them into Oncorhynchus, which includes rainbow, cutthroat, and other trout. So, all three mentioned types (Brown, American Rainbow, Cutthroat) are part of the rainbow trout family or types within the Oncorhynchus genus.

Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly mention "Brown" trout. It does mention brown trout in the taxonomic part, but the question is about Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat. Since the context groups rainbow, ['trouting', 'ocean trout', 'trout fishing', 'trout']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In 1936, Sergei Prokofiev was commissioned by Natalya Sats and the Central Children's Theatre in Moscow to write a new musical symphony for children. The intent was to cultivate "musical tastes in children from the first years of school".  Intrigued by the invitation, Prokofiev completed Peter and the Wolf in just four days.  The debut on 2 May 1936 was, in the composer's words, inauspicious at best: "... [attendance] was poor and failed to attract much attention".

Peter and the Wolf (Russian: –ü–µ—Ç—è –∏ –≤–æ–ª–∫, Petya i volk), Op. 67, is a composition written by Sergei Prokofiev in 1936 in the USSR. It is a children's story (with both music and text by Prokofiev), spoken by a narrator accompanied by the orchestra.

History

American music reviewer Gary R. Lemco has viewed Peter and the Wolf as an allegory for the political situation of the Soviet Union in the 1930s. According to this theory, the characters represent either the various bickering Soviet republics, or the nations of Europe. For example, Peter, bearing the same name as Russian national hero Peter the Great, represents Russia. In both versions of the theory, the Wolf represents the virulently anti-Communist Nazi Germany. 

Recordings

* In February 2004, ex-president Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Sophia Loren won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for narrating the album Peter and the Wolf/Wolf Tracks. This recording was performed by the Russian National Orchestra conducted by Kent Nagano and included Ms. Loren narrating Peter and the Wolf and Clinton narrating The Wolf and Peter by Jean-Pascal Beintus, which is also a narrated orchestral piece, but the story is told from the perspective of thewolf and has the theme of letting animals live in peace.

* Justin Locke wrote a 1985 sequel to the story, using the original score. Peter VS. the Wolf is the Wolf's trial, where he defends himself against the charge of "Duckicide in the first degree, with one gulp." The original music is presented as evidence, but then the Wolf calls individual musicians to the stand and cross-examines them. It requires five actors for a stage presentation. 
* In 1985, Arnie Zane choreographed a punk music ballet version of Peter and the Wolf.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated a punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk rock, thrash metal and alternative rock musicians.

The Sex Pistols' concert of 4 June 1976 at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall was to become one of the most significant and mythologised events in rock history. Among the audience of forty people or so were many who became leading figures in the punk and post-punk movements: Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, who organised the gig and were in the process of auditioning new members for the Buzzcocks; Bernard Sumner, Ian Curtis and Peter Hook, later of Joy Division; Mark E. Smith, later of the

History 

Origins and early days 

The Sex Pistols evolved from the Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums, and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to music performances, and when the concert was over they  would go up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.

The first incarnation of the Sex Pistols included singer Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), lead guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious (John Ritchie) early in 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, a visual artist, performer, clothes designer and boutique owner, the band provoked controversies that garnered a significant amount of publicity. Their concerts repeatedly faced difficulties with organisers and local authorities, and

The 1978 "No One Is Innocent"/"My Way" was followed in 1979 by Vicious's cover of "Something Else" (number three, and the biggest-selling single ever under the Sex Pistols name); Jones singing an original, "Silly Thing" (number six); and Vicious's second Cochran cover, "C'mon Everybody" (number three). Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Pistols brand‚ÄîTudor-Pole, among others, singing "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" and a Rotten vocal from 1976, "(I'm Not Your)



Question: What was the name of the band, featuring members of Thin Lizzy and the Sex Pistols, which recorded a 1979 song called ‚ÄòA Merry Jingle‚Äô? 

Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the band that includes members from Thin Lizzy and the Sex Pistols, and they recorded a song called 'A Merry Jingle' in 1979. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Sex Pistols were a major punk rock band, and they had members like Steve Jones, Paul Cook, Johnny Rotten, and Glen Matlock. But the question mentions that the band also includes members from Thin Lizzy. Thin Lizzy is another well-known rock band, known for their work in the punk and rock genres as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the Sex Pistols and Thin Lizzy had overlapping members. Let me think. I recall that the Sex Pistols had a bassist named Glen Matlock, but I don't think he was part of Thin Lizzy. Johnny Rotten, who was John Lydon, was the lead singer of the Sex Pistols, but I don't think he was in Thin Lizzy either. So maybe the band in question has some other members from both groups.

The song 'A Merry Jingle' was released in 1979. I think that might be a Christmas song, given the name. I'm trying to remember if any bands from that time released such a song. I know that the Ramones did some holiday songs, but I don't think they're the ones here.

Wait, the question says the band features members from both Thin Lizzy and the Sex Pistols. So perhaps it's a supergroup or a collaboration. Let me think about the possible members. Thin Lizzy had Phil Lynott as their lead singer, along with Brian Downey on drums, Eric Bell on guitar, and others. The Sex Pistols had Steve Jones, Paul Cook, Johnny Rotten, and Glen Matlock.

I'm trying to remember if any combination of these members formed a band together. Alternatively, maybe it's a band that includes both some original members of the Sex Pistols and some from Thin Lizzy.

Wait, another thought: the question mentions that the band recorded 'A Merry Jingle' in 1979. I think that song was actually recorded by the Sex Pistols, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's by another band. Alternatively, perhaps it's a song by the Damned or another punk band.

Wait, no, the Damned are another punk band, but I don't think they did that song. Let me think again. The song 'A Merry Jingle' sounds like a Christmas song, and I think it was released by the Sex Pistols, but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's by a different band.

Wait, another angle: the band in question includes members from both the Sex Pistols and Thin Lizzy. So perhaps it's a band that has some original members from each group. Let me think about possible lineups. ['greedies originally greedy bastards']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Louse (plural: lice) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, bats and cetaceans. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.

A louse's color varies from pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their

Nearly 5,000 species of louse have been identified, about 4,000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent in all the habitats that their host animals and birds occupy. They are found even in the Antarctic, where penguins carry 15 species of lice (in the genera Austrogonoides and Nesiotinus).

Lice are divided into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their nourishment from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and

* Anoplura: sucking lice, occurring on mammals exclusively
* Rhynchophthirina: parasites of elephants and warthogs
* Ischnocera: mostly avian chewing lice, however, one family parasitizes mammals
* Amblycera: a primitive suborder of chewing lice, widespread on birds, however, also live on South-American and Australian mammals

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Congo, Sensation, President Grevy and Beauty of Moscow are all varieties of which garden plant?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about four different terms, and they're all types of a specific garden plant. My task is to identify which plant these names correspond to.

Looking at the context provided, I see that Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga is mentioned, but I'm not sure if that's directly related. The context talks about his presidency, relationships with other countries, and his family. However, the question is about garden plants, so I might need to think differently.

The names given are Congo, Sensation, President Grevy, and Beauty of Moscow. These sound like plant names. I'm trying to recall if I know any plants by these names. 

I remember that "Congo" is a type of bean, specifically the Congo bean, which is a legume. "Sensation" could refer to a plant, perhaps a type of rose or another flowering plant. "President Grevy" might be a specific variety, maybe of a fruit or vegetable. "Beauty of Moscow" sounds like it could be a variety of a flowering plant, perhaps a rose or another ornamental plant.

Wait, I think "Congo" is also known as the Congo bean, which is a type of broad bean. "Sensation" might be a type of rose, like the 'Sensation' rose. "President Grevy" could be a potato variety, perhaps the President Grevy potato. "Beauty of Moscow" might be a type of rose as well, like the 'Beauty of Moscow' rose.

But the question is asking for a single garden plant that all four names are varieties of. So, perhaps they are all roses? Or maybe they are all beans? Wait, no, because Congo is a bean, but the others might not be.

Alternatively, maybe they are all types of roses. 'Sensation' is a well-known rose, and 'Beauty of Moscow' is also a rose variety. 'President Grevy' could be a potato, but if the others are roses, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe 'Congo' is a type of bean, but the others don't fit that category.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about garden plants, and the four terms are all names of varieties. So, perhaps they are all roses. 'Congo' might be a specific rose, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are all types of sweet peas or another plant.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, plants have multiple names or trade names. For example, 'Congo' could be a trade name for a specific variety. ['lilac bush', 'syringa vulgaris', 'lilac', 'common lilac']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (often referred to as Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. or just simply WB) is an American entertainment company. As one of the major film studios, it is a division of Time Warner, with its headquarters in Burbank, California. Warner Bros. has several subsidiary companies, including Warner Bros. Pictures, Turner Entertainment Co., Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Animation, Warner Home Video, New Line Cinema, CastleRock Entertainment, and DC Entertainment. Warner Bros. owns half of The CW Television Network.

In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System, by then having failed to acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, settled for ownership of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists library. This included almost all of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries with the exception of the films & television series owned by United Artists (i.e. James Bond franchise), although some United Artists material were included such as the a.a.p. library, North American rights to a majority of the RKO Radio Pictures libraryand the television series Gilligan's Island.

In 1933, Warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan Films. Hearst had previously worked with MGM, but ended the association after a dispute with head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Hearst's longstanding mistress, actress Marion Davies, who was struggling for box office success. Through his partnership with Hearst, Warner signed Davies to a studio contract. Hearst's company and Davies' films, however, did not increase the studio'sprofits.

In the aftermath of the 1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950 films and cartoons to a holding company called Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also got the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Popeye cartoons, originally from Paramount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold to United Artists, which held them until 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired United Artists.

As the studio prospered, it gained backing from Wall Street, and in 1924 Goldman Sachs arranged a major loan. With this new money, the Warners bought the pioneer Vitagraph Company which had a nationwide distribution system. In 1925, Warners' also experimented in radio, establishing a successful radio station, KFWB, in Los Angeles.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In jazz and bluegrass, and the few popular music styles which use double bass (such as French modern chanson, American psychobilly and rockabilly), pizzicato is the usual way to play the double bass. This is unusual for a violin-family instrument, because regardless whether violin-family instruments are being used in jazz (e.g., jazz violin), popular, traditional (e.g., Bluegrass fiddle) or Classical music, they are usually played with the bow for most of a performance. In classical double bass

Pizzicato (; , translated as pinched, and sometimes roughly as plucked) 
is a playing technique that involves plucking the strings of a string instrument. The exact technique varies somewhat depending on the type of stringed instrument.

bass, this style of snap pizzicato, or "slapping", was used in jazz since the 1920s and later used in rockabilly. Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings so that they make a rhythmic "slap" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and allowed the bass to be more easily heard on

Bart√≥k also made use of pizzicato glissandi, executed by plucking a note and then sliding the stopping finger up or down the string. This technique can be heard in his Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta.

playing, pizzicato are often performed with the bow being held in the hand; as such, the string is usually only plucked with a single finger. In contrast, in jazz, bluegrass, and other non-Classical styles, the player is not usually holding a bow, so they are free to use two or three fingers to pluck the string.



Question: On which instrument would a ‚Äòparadiddle‚Äô be played? 

Okay, so I need to figure out on which instrument a 'paradiddle' would be played. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context talks about pizzicato, which is a technique used in various music styles, including jazz, bluegrass, and others. It mentions that in these styles, the double bass is usually played with the bow, but in some cases, like in jazz since the 1920s, they use a slap style, which is a form of pizzicato. It also mentions that in classical music, double basses are typically played with the bow, not plucked.

Wait, the context is about pizzicato and slap styles, but the question is about 'paradiddle'. I don't recall 'paradiddle' being mentioned in the context. Hmm, maybe I need to think about what 'paradiddle' refers to. Paradiddle is a technique in drumming where the right hand plays a paradiddle pattern, which is a specific rudiment. But in the context, the discussion is about string instruments and their playing techniques.

Wait, perhaps the context is trying to set up a question about which instrument uses paradiddle, but the term 'paradiddle' isn't directly mentioned. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or confusion with 'pizzicato'. But the context does talk about pizzicato on double bass in jazz and other styles.

Wait, the context says that in classical music, double basses are usually played with the bow, not plucked. So, in non-classical styles like jazz, they use pizzicato, which is plucking. So, the double bass is used with pizzicato in those styles.

But the question is about 'paradiddle'. I'm not sure if that's a typo or if it's a different technique. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a technique on a double bass. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the context is trying to set up that in non-classical styles, the double bass is played with pizzicato, which is plucking, and in classical, it's played with the bow. So, the question is about which instrument uses 'paradiddle', which I think is a typo for 'pizzicato'.

Assuming that, the context says that in jazz and bluegrass, the double bass is played with pizzicato. So, the instrument would be the double bass.

Alternatively, if 'paradiddle' is a different technique, perhaps it's played on a different instrument, but I'm not sure. Since the context doesn't mention 'paradiddle', I might have to infer based on the information given.

Wait, the context mentions that in classical music, the double bass is usually played with the bow, not plucked. So, in non-classical styles, they use pizzicato.

Okay, so I need to figure out which Clydeside town has IBM Halt as one of its nine railway stations. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the context mentions several areas on Glasgow's South Side, including Govan, Ibrox, Pollokshaws, etc. It also talks about the International Financial Services District (IFSD) and some other places like Blythswood Hill and Anderston. But the question is specifically about IBM Halt being one of nine railway stations in a Clydeside town.

Wait, Clydeside refers to the area along the River Clyde, which includes parts of Glasgow. The context lists several areas on the South Side, but I'm not sure if all of them are part of Clydeside. I know that Clydeside is a term that can refer to the entire Clyde Valley, but in the context of Glasgow, it might refer to specific areas.

The question mentions "Clydeside town," which I think refers to a town within Clydeside. The context lists several areas on the South Side, but I'm not sure which ones are part of Clydeside. Wait, the context also mentions Govan, which is on the South Side, and Ibrox, which is another area. But I'm not sure if all these areas are part of Clydeside.

Wait, the context says that Govan is a district on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. So, since Partick is on the north bank, Govan is on the south bank, making it part of Clydeside. The question is about a town where IBM Halt is one of nine railway stations. So, the town in question is likely Govan because the context mentions IBM Halt in relation to Govan's legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding center.

Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly mention IBM Halt in Govan. It does mention that Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding center, home to BAE Systems and Thales Optronics, and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. It also mentions the Glasgow Subway system's maintenance depot there. But the question is about IBM Halt being one of nine railway stations in a Clydeside town.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The context lists several areas on the South Side, including Govan, Ibrox, Pollokshaws, etc. The question is about a Clydeside town with nine railway stations, one of which is IBM Halt. Since the context doesn't mention IBM Halt, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the answer is that the town is Govan because it's a Clydeside town and part of the South Side. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the town is Ibrox or another area.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: A wingsuit was first used in 1930 by a 19-year-old American, Rex Finney of Los Angeles, California, as an attempt to increase horizontal movement and maneuverability during a parachute jump.    These early wingsuits were made of materials such as canvas, wood, silk, steel, and whalebone.  They were not very reliable, although some "birdmen", notably Clem Sohn and Leo Valentin, claimed to have glided for miles.

Wingsuit flying (or wingsuiting) is the sport of gliding through the air using a wingsuit which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift. The modern wingsuit, first developed in the late 1990s, creates a surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms.  Wingsuits are sometimes referred to as "birdman suits" (after the makers of the first commercially available wingsuit), "flying squirrel suits" (due to their resemblance to the animal), and "batsuits" (due to their resemblance to the animal or perhaps the superhero).

An early attempt at wingsuit flying was made on 4 February 1912 by a 33-year-old tailor, Franz Reichelt, who jumped from the Eiffel Tower to test his invention of a combination of parachute and wing, which was similar to modern wingsuits. He misled the guards by saying that the experiment was going to be conducted with a dummy. He hesitated quite a long time before he jumped, and hit the ground head first, opening a measurable hole in the frozen ground.

The wingsuit flier enters free fall wearing both a wingsuit and parachute equipment. Exiting an aircraft in a wingsuit requires skilled techniques that differ depending on the location and size of the aircraft door. These techniques include the orientation relative to the aircraft and the airflow while exiting, and the way in which the flier spreads his legs and arms at the proper time so as not to hit the aircraft or become unstable. The wingsuit immediately starts to fly upon exiting the

Christian Stadler from Germany organized the first international wingsuit competition to feature a monetary prize, in 2005, called "SkyJester's Wings Over Marl". His "VegaV3 wingsuit system" uses an electronic adjustable hydrogen peroxide rocket.  The rocket provides 1000 Newtons (100 kgf) of thrust and produces no flames or poisonous fumes. His first successful powered wingsuit jump was in 2007, when he reached horizontal speeds of over 255¬†km/h (160¬†mph).



Question: "Which Pixar character's first attempt to fly is comically described as ""falling with style""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out which Pixar character's first attempt to fly is described as "falling with style." Let me start by recalling Pixar's characters. They have a lot of famous ones like Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie, etc. 

The question mentions a first attempt to fly, and it's comically described as "falling with style." Hmm, I think this might be Buzz Lightyear. In the movie "Toy Story," Buzz is known for trying to fly but failing in a comedic way. 

Wait, but Buzz is more of a toy than a character with a wingsuit. Oh, but the context given is about wingsuits, which are used in gliding sports. So maybe it's a different character. 

Wait, another thought: In "The Incredibles," there's a character named Mr. Incredible. He's a superhero, but I don't recall him using a wingsuit. Alternatively, maybe it's from "WALL-E." No, WALL-E is more about space travel. 

Wait, perhaps it's from "A Bug's Life." There's a character named Flik, a tiny insect who tries to be a leader. But I don't think he's associated with wingsuits. 

Wait, another angle: The context mentions wingsuits, which are used in gliding. So maybe the character is trying to glide or fly using a wingsuit. In the context, the first wingsuit was used by Rex Finney in 1930. But that's real life, not Pixar. 

Wait, perhaps it's a reference to a Pixar movie where a character attempts to fly in a wingsuit-like manner. Maybe in "The Incredibles," but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's from "Wingsuit" movie, but that's not Pixar. 

Wait, maybe it's from "Finding Nemo." No, that's more about underwater stuff. 

Wait, another thought: The term "falling with style" sounds like it's a humorous take on a failed attempt. In "The Incredibles," Mr. Incredible's first attempt to fly might be comical. But I'm not sure if it's described as "falling with style." 

Wait, perhaps it's from "WALL-E." No, WALL-E is more about space. 

Wait, maybe it's from "Cars." In "Cars," there's a character named Luigi who is a race car. But I don't think he's associated with wingsuits. 

Wait, perhaps it's from "Zootopia." No, that's more about animals in a city. 

Wait, another angle: The term "falling with style" might be a reference to a specific scene. Maybe in "The Incredibles," when Mr. Incredible tries to fly but fails in a funny way. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's from "Inside Out." No, that ['buzz lightyear toy story', 'buz lightyear', 'buzz light year', 'to infinity and beyond', 'mrs nesbit', 'buzz toy story', 'javier fernandez pe√±a', 'buzz lightyear']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926¬†‚Äì August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing "dumb blonde" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon.

Monroe starred in three movies released in 1953, emerging as a major sex symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers.  The first of these was the Technicolor film noir Niagara, in which she played a femme fatale scheming to murder her husband, played by Joseph Cotten. By then, Monroe and her make-up artist Allan "Whitey" Snyder had developed the make-up look that became associated with her: dark arched brows, pale skin, "glistening" red lips and a beauty mark. According to Sarah

the radio on". Having begun her career as a pin-up model, Monroe's hourglass figure was one of her most often noted features. Film scholar Richard Dyer has written that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and in her publicity photos often posed like a pin-up. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body, earning her the nickname "the girl with the horizontal walk".

Monroe's screen persona centered on her blond hair, and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, na√Øvet√©, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with double entendres that came to be known as "Monroeisms". For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, "I had

Monroe was listed in the annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in both 1953 and 1954, and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studio's "greatest asset" alongside CinemaScope. Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December, when Hugh Hefner featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue of Playboy. The cover image was a shot of her at the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs.Conflicts with 20th Century-Fox and marriage to Joe DiMaggio (1954‚Äì55)

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Yorkshire is a historic county of England, centred on the county town of York. The region was first occupied after the retreat of the ice age around 8000¬†BC. During the first millennium AD it was occupied by Romans, Angles and Vikings. The name comes from "Eborakon" (c. 150) an old Brythonic name which probably derives from "Efor" or "the place of the yew-trees." Many Yorkshire dialect words and aspects of pronunciation derive from old Norse  due to the Viking influence in this region. The name

*Bowes and the rest of Startforth Rural District was transferred from the North Riding to County Durham
*Middlesbrough, Redcar and nearby areas were transferred from the North Riding to Cleveland.  The area was returned to Yorkshire in 1996 as part of the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire.
*most of the East Riding was transferred to Humberside.  The area became the larger part of the new ceremonial county of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1996.*Goole and Goole Rural District was transferred from the West Riding to Humberside. The area became part of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1996.

The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood.  The Rivers Aire and Calder  are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstreamof Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby.

Sheffield, situated amongst a number of fast-flowing rivers and streams surrounded by hills containing raw materials such as coal, iron ore, ganister, and millstone grit for grindstones, made it an ideal place for water-powered industries to develop. Water wheels were often initially built for the milling of corn, but many were converted to the manufacture of blades. As early as the 14th century Sheffield was noted for the production of knives, as noted in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Reeve‚Äôs Talefrom The Canterbury Tales

The remaining areas of the East Riding and the North Riding, the city of York and northern and eastern areas of the West Riding became North Yorkshire.

The remaining areas of the West Riding became the metropolitan counties of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The hat's name derives from the stage adaptation of George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby. A hat of this style was worn in the first London production of the play, and promptly came to be called "a Trilby hat".

A trilby is a narrow-brimmed type of hat. The trilby was once viewed as the rich man's favored hat; it is sometimes called the "brown trilby" in Britain  and was frequently seen at the horse races. The London hat company Lock and Co. describes the trilby as having a "shorter brim which is angled down at the front and slightly turned up at the back" versus the fedora's "wider brim which is more level." The trilby also has a slightly shorter crown than a typical fedora design.

The hat saw a resurgence in popularity in the early 1980s, when it was marketed to both men and women in an attempt to capitalise on a retro fashion trend. 

Its shape somewhat resembles the Tyrolean hat.

Traditionally it is made from rabbit hair felt, but is usually made from other materials, such as tweed, straw, wool and wool/nylon blends. The hat reached its zenith of common popularity in the 1960s; the lower head clearance in American automobiles made it impractical to wear a hat with a tall crown while driving. It faded from popularity in the 1970s when any type of men's headwear went out of fashion, and men's fashion instead began focusing on highly maintained hairstyles.





Question: Which Type of hat takes its name from an 1894 novel by George Du Maurier where the Title character has the surname O'Ferrall ? 
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which type of hat takes its name from an 1894 novel by George Du Maurier where the title character has the surname O'Ferrall. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that George Du Maurier was an author, and the novel in question is from 1894. The title character's last name is O'Ferrall. I'm trying to recall if any of his novels have a main character with that surname. I remember that Du Maurier wrote "Trilby," which was adapted into a play. The context provided earlier mentions that the trilby hat's name comes from the stage adaptation of "Trilby," a novel by Du Maurier. 

Wait, but the question is about a character with the surname O'Ferrall. I'm not sure if that's from "Trilby." Let me think. In "Trilby," the main character is named Trilby, but I don't recall the surname being O'Ferrall. Maybe I'm confusing it with another novel. Alternatively, perhaps the hat's name isn't directly tied to that character but to the play adaptation. 

Wait, the context says the hat's name comes from the stage adaptation of "Trilby," so the hat is called a Trilby hat. But the question is about a hat named after a character with the surname O'Ferrall. Maybe I'm mixing up the names. Alternatively, perhaps the hat's name is derived from the novel's title, not the character's surname. 

Wait, the context also mentions that the trilby was once viewed as the rich man's favored hat and is sometimes called the "brown trilby" in Britain. It was popular in the 1960s but faded in the 70s. The hat's shape resembles the Tyrolean hat. It's made from materials like rabbit hair felt, tweed, straw, wool, and wool/nylon blends. 

But the question is specifically about a hat named after a character with the surname O'Ferrall from Du Maurier's 1894 novel. I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the hat's name isn't directly linked to that character. Alternatively, perhaps the hat's name is derived from the play adaptation, which might have a character with that surname. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to piece it together. The trilby hat's name comes from "Trilby," the novel. The main character in "Trilby" is Trilby O'Ferrall? Or is that another character? I'm not certain. Maybe I should look up the characters in "Trilby." 

Upon reflection, I think the main character in "Trilby" is named Trilby, but I'm not sure about ['trilby', 'trilby hat']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The book has won many awards but also been at the center of numerous censorship and culture war debates on same-sex marriage, adoption, and homosexuality in animals. The American Library Association reports that And Tango Makes Three was the most challenged book of 2006 to 2010, except for 2009 when it was the second most challenged.   

Plot synopsis

Reception

Due to the penguin parents being of the same sex, some adults have objected to children reading the book. Homosexuality in animals is seen as controversial by some social conservatives, who believe that asserting the naturalness of animal homosexuality affects the morality of homosexuality in humans. Others believe that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to morality.

Candi Cushman, education analyst for Focus on the Family Action, said the book is far from a ‚Äútrue story‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very misleading,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs a very disingenuous, inaccurate way to promote a political agenda to little kids". Silo's heterosexual behavior was widely reported in national news, including the Chicago Tribune.

describing the book as presenting issues of sexuality to children too young to understand them, asked that the book be removed from the library, shelved with adult books on sexuality, or marked with a "red dot" to alert parents to its controversial nature. The parent charged that the book's statement that penguins Roy and Silo "slept together" is a reference to sexual behavior between the birds.

The three books, And Tango Makes Three, The White Swan Express, which features children adopted by a variety of families including gay, mixed-race and single parents, and Who‚Äôs In My Family, discusses families, including references to gay couples, came to the attention of religious conservatives two weeks after Pink Dot SG, a gay rights rally. The rally "sparked a fierce debate" between the religious conservatives opposed to the event and Singapore's growing gay-rights lobby." The NLB is a

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: ' ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius (as ') to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step, he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate and began his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase has been adopted in Italian (), Romanian (), Spanish (), French (), Portuguese (), Greek (), Dutch (), German (), Polish (), Turkish (), and many other languages toindicate that events have passed a point of no return.

Suetonius, a contemporary of Plutarch writing in Latin, reports a similar phrase.

Lewis and Short,  citing Casaubon and Ruhnk, suggest that the text of Suetonius should read Iacta alea esto (reading the imperative ESTO instead of EST), which they translate as "Let the die be cast!", or  "Let the game be ventured!". This matches Plutarch's use of third-person singular middle/passive perfect imperative of ,  i.e.  (',).

By the first century AD alea refers to the early form of backgammon that was played in Caesar's time. Augustus (Octavian) mentions winning this game in a letter. Dice were common in Roman times, and generally known in Latin as cubus  and in Greek as  kybos "die" and  kybeia "dice-playing".

Meaning and forms

The historian Frances Titchener has given a stylized description of the context of Caesar's pronouncement:

Caesar was said to have borrowed the phrase from Menander, his favourite Greek writer of comedy; the phrase appears in ‚Äú·ºàœÅœÅŒ∑œÜœåœÅŒøœÇ‚Äù (Arrephoros,) (or possibly ‚ÄúThe Flute-Girl‚Äù), as quoted in Deipnosophistae, [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/athenee/XIII.htm Book 13], paragraph 8. Plutarch reports that these words were said in Greek:





Question: Considered unlucky in Italy, probably because its Roman numerals are an anagram of a Latin word which can mean loosely 'I have lived', implying 'I am dead' ? What is the word?
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Considered unlucky in Italy, probably because its Roman numerals are an anagram of a Latin word which can mean loosely 'I have lived', implying 'I am dead' ? What is the word?"

First, I'll break down the question. The user is referring to something considered unlucky in Italy, specifically related to Roman numerals. The numerals are an anagram of a Latin word that means "I have lived" or "I am dead."

I remember that in Roman culture, certain numerals or combinations were considered unlucky. One famous example is the number 13, which is often seen as unlucky in many Western cultures, including Italy. But the question is about the numerals being an anagram of a Latin word.

I think the Latin word they're referring to is "habeas" or "habeo." Wait, "habeo" means "I have" or "I possess." But the question mentions "I have lived" and "I am dead." Maybe it's "habeas" or another form.

Wait, another thought: the word could be "habeas corpus," which is a legal term meaning "body of the accused." But that doesn't fit exactly. Alternatively, "habeo" is the first person singular active present of "habere," which means "to have." So "habeo" is "I have." But the question says "I have lived," which is more like "vividi" or "vixi." Wait, "vixi" is a Latin term meaning "I lived."

Wait, but the user says the numerals are an anagram of a Latin word meaning "I have lived," implying "I am dead." So maybe the word is "habeo" or "habeas," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's "habeo" because "habeo" can be associated with "have" and "lived" through some metaphor.

Wait, another angle: the word could be "habeo" because "habeo" can be linked to the idea of having lived. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "habeas corpus," but that doesn't fit the "I have lived" part.

Wait, perhaps the word is "habeo." Let me think: "habeo" is "I have," but "I have lived" would be "habeo" plus "vixi" or something. Maybe the user is referring to "habeo" as the anagram, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the word could be "habeo" because "habeo" is an anagram of "hoveo," but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's ['seventeen', '17']

Question: Three what feature on the insignia or badge of the abortive Apollo 13 lunar misson? The answer is three letters, each representing a feature.

</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Three what feature on the insignia or badge of the abortive Apollo 13 lunar mission?" The answer should be three letters, each representing a feature. 

First, I remember that the Apollo 13 mission had some challenges, especially with the oxygen tank explosion. The mission was supposed to land on the Moon but had to abort. The book "Lost Moon" by James Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger talks about this. 

The question is about the features on the badge or insignia related to this mission. I think the badge would have symbols representing the elements that went wrong or the solutions used. 

I recall that during the Apollo 13 mission, the astronauts used the Lunar Module (LM) as a lifeboat. So, the LM would be a key feature. Also, the explosion involved a liquid oxygen tank, so the oxygen tank might be another feature. Additionally, the Command Module, Odyssey, was crucial in returning them safely, so that might be the third feature.

Putting it together, the three features could be LM, O2 (for oxygen), and Odyssey. So the letters would be L, O, and O. Wait, but the question says three letters, each representing a feature. So maybe it's L, O, and O, but that's two letters if we count O twice. Alternatively, perhaps it's L, O, and D for the Command Module, which is Odyssey. Hmm, but the question specifies three features, each represented by a letter.

Wait, the mission had to use the LM as a lifeboat, so LM is one. The oxygen tank failure was a key issue, so O2 is another. The Command Module, Odyssey, was used to return safely, so O again? Or maybe the third feature is the Command Module, which is Odyssey, but that's a word, not a single letter. Alternatively, maybe the third feature is the Service Module, but that's not a single letter either.

Wait, perhaps the three features are the LM, the oxygen tank (O2), and the Command Module (Odyssey). But since each feature is a single letter, maybe it's L, O, and D. Because the Command Module is Odyssey, which starts with O, but D is part of it. Alternatively, maybe it's L, O, and E, but I'm not sure.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Scrying (also called seeing or peeping) is the practice of looking into a translucent ball or other material with the belief that things can be seen, such as spiritual visions, and less often for purposes of divination or fortune-telling.

Although scrying is most commonly done with a crystal ball, it may also be performed using any smooth surface, such as a bowl of liquid, a pond, or a crystal. Like other aspects of divination and parapsychology, scrying is not supported by science as a method of predicting the future.  

Method

The most common media used are reflective, translucent, or luminescent substances such as crystals, stones, glass, mirrors, water, fire, or smoke. Scrying has been used in many cultures in the belief that it can divine the past, present, or future. The visions that come when one stares into the media are believed by some to come from one's subconscious and imagination, though others believe they come from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice.

One method of scrying using a crystal ball involves a self-induced trance. Initially, the medium serves as a focus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind in the same way as a mantra. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer begins a free association with the perceived images suggested. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, is done with the intent of deepening the

Scrying is not supported by science as a method of predicting the future. Some critics consider it to be a pseudoscience.  Skeptics consider scrying to be the result of delusion or wishful thinking.  

Psychologist Leonard Zusne suggested that scrying images are hallucinations or hypnagogic experiences.



Question: Scrying commonly entails the use of a? 
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Scrying commonly entails the use of a?" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The context describes scrying as a practice where one looks into a translucent material, like a crystal ball, for spiritual visions or divination. It mentions that while a crystal ball is the most common, it can also be done with other smooth surfaces, such as a bowl of liquid, a pond, or a crystal. It also notes that scrying isn't supported by science and is considered a pseudoscience by critics.

The question is asking what scrying commonly entails the use of a. So, I need to identify the common media used in scrying. From the context, the most common media are listed as "reflective, translucent, or luminescent substances such as crystals, stones, glass, mirrors, water, fire, or smoke." Additionally, it's mentioned that the media can be a crystal ball, bowl of liquid, pond, or crystal.

So, the common items used are things like crystals, glass, mirrors, water, etc. The question is asking for the common use, so the answer would be one of these items. Since the context starts by mentioning a crystal ball as the most common, but also includes others, the answer should reflect that.

Looking at the question again, it's asking what scrying commonly entails the use of a. So, the answer is likely a crystal ball, but also possibly others. However, the most common is a crystal ball, so that might be the primary answer. Alternatively, since the context lists multiple possible media, the answer might be any of those, but the question is about what it "commonly" entails, so the most common would be a crystal ball.

Wait, but the context says "the most common media used are..." and lists several, so perhaps the answer is any of those, but the question is about what it commonly entails, so the answer is a crystal ball, bowl of liquid, pond, or crystal. But the question is singular, so maybe it's looking for the primary one, which is a crystal ball.

Alternatively, the question might be asking for the common method, which involves using a smooth surface, but the context specifically lists the materials. So, the answer is a crystal ball, bowl of liquid, pond, or crystal.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "Scrying is commonly done with a?" So, the answer would be a crystal ball, but also possibly others. However, the question is singular, so perhaps the answer is a crystal ball.

Wait, but the context says "the most common media used are..." and lists several, so the answer isn't just one, but the question is asking what it commonly entails the use of a, so the answer is any of those, but the ['crystal ball', 'shew stone', 'show stone', 'crystal balls', 'üîÆ']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: On a modern grand piano with three pedals, the middle pedal is usually a sostenuto pedal. It sustains only those notes that are being held down when the pedal is depressed, allowing future notes played to be unaffected. It is commonly abbreviated "S.P.", "Sost. Ped.", or "ThP." (from the German equivalent "Tonhalte-Pedal").

On some upright pianos and lower-quality grand pianos, the middle pedal sustains all notes in the bass register, but this is not a true sostenuto pedal. On other uprights, the middle pedal is a practice pedal (with a locking option), which makes the sound extremely quiet beyond the standard soft pedal. This is often achieved by dropping a felt cloth between the hammers and the strings when the practice pedal is depressed. Not all pianos have a Sostenuto pedal, however. Some older, or modernlow-quality uprights do not have this option.The sostenuto pedal should not be confused with the much more commonly used sustain pedal, which undampens all the strings on the piano.

In music, sostenuto is a term from Italian that means "sustained". It occasionally implies a slowing of tempo, though more often it refers to a very legato style in which the notes are performed in a sustained manner beyond their normal values.

Sostenuto pedal





Question: Meaning 'quiet loud' what is the full modern Italian name for the piano? (Note: The answer is a single word, the piano's full name. The question is about the Italian name, not the abbreviation or German term.)
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Meaning 'quiet loud' what is the full modern Italian name for the piano?" The context provided is about various pedals on a piano, including the sostenuto pedal, but the question is about the Italian name for the piano itself. 

First, I should break down the question. The clue is the phrase "meaning 'quiet loud'". I think "quiet loud" might be a translation from another language, perhaps Italian. Let me think about what "quiet loud" could mean in Italian. "Quiet" in Italian is "quieto" or "silenzioso", and "loud" is "loudo" or "forte". But "quiet loud" together might not be a direct translation. Alternatively, maybe it's a phrase that refers to a specific feature of the piano.

Wait, the context mentions the sostenuto pedal, which is related to sustaining notes, but the question is about the piano's name. So perhaps the piano's name in Italian is related to the term "quiet loud". Let me think about the word "piano" in Italian. The word "piano" itself is the same in Italian, but maybe there's a specific term for a type of piano. 

I recall that some types of pianos have specific names. For example, grand piano, upright piano, spinet. But the question is about the full modern Italian name. The clue is "quiet loud", which might relate to a specific feature. Maybe it's referring to a type of piano that's quieter or has a specific sound. 

Wait, the sostenuto pedal is described as sustaining only those notes held down, allowing future notes to be unaffected. That's different from the sustain pedal which affects all strings. So the sostenuto pedal is more specific. But how does that relate to the piano's name?

Alternatively, maybe "quiet loud" refers to a specific type of piano. Let me think about the Italian terms. "Pianoforte" is the Italian name for piano, but that's the general term. Maybe there's a specific type. 

Wait, the context mentions that the sostenuto pedal is sometimes called "ThP." from the German equivalent. But the question is about the piano's name, not the pedal. 

The question says "meaning 'quiet loud' what is the full modern Italian name for the piano?" So "quiet loud" might be a translation of a specific term. Let me think about the Italian word for "quiet" and "loud". "Quiet" is "quieto", "loud" is "lento" or "forte". But "quiet loud" together doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to ['pianie', 'classical piano', 'acoustic piano', 'vertical piano', 'black key', 'vertical pianoforte', 'grand pianoforte', 'piano music', 'upright pianoforte', 'pianino', 'upright piano', 'baby grand piano', 'pianoforte', 'pianos', 'piano construction', 'piano', 'piano keys', 'parts of piano', 'piano hammer', 'pianofortes', 'hammer piano', 'grand piano', 'piano forte', 'keyboard hammer', 'piano technique', 'keyboard hammers', 'concert grand', 'piano hammers', 'piano performance']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Matthew Boulton  (; 3 September 1728 ‚Äì 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.  In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills.  Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying theRoyal Mint with up-to-date equipment.

Boulton founded the Soho Mint, to which he soon adapted steam power.  He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage, and after several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century.  His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper British penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971.  He retired in 1800, though continuing torun his mint, and died in 1809.  His image appears alongside James Watt on the Bank of England's new Series F ¬£50 note.Background

Partnership with Watt

the date 1797), all other strikings used lighter planchets to reflect the rise in the price of copper, and featured more conventional designs.  Boulton greatly reduced the counterfeiting problem by adding lines to the coin edges, and striking slightly concave planchets.  Counterfeiters turned their sights to easier targets, the pre-Soho pieces, which were not withdrawn, due to the expense, until a gradual withdrawal took place between 1814 and 1817.Watt, in his eulogy after Boulton's death in 1809, stated:

Matthew Boulton College was named in his honour in 1957. The two-hundredth anniversary of his death, in 2009, resulted in a number of tributes.  Birmingham City Council promoted "a year long festival celebrating the life, work and legacy of Matthew Boulton".



Question: G-BOAG, G-BOAC, and F-BVFC and the tragic F-BTSC designated what iconic 20thC invention? 

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me parse it.

The question is: G-BOAG, G-BOAC, and F-BVFC and the tragic F-BTSC designated what iconic 20thC invention?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which iconic 20th-century invention is designated by those codes: G-BOAG, G-BOAC, F-BVFC, and F-BTSC.

Wait, but the context given is about Matthew Boulton and James Watt, who were involved in steam engines and coin minting. So perhaps the question is referring to the steam engine, which was an invention in the 18th century, but maybe in the 20th century, it's considered iconic.

Wait, but the question is about the 20th-century invention. So perhaps the answer is the steam engine, but that was in the 18th century. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to something else.

Wait, the context mentions that Boulton & Watt's steam engines were a great advance, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. So the steam engine is an 18th-century invention, but perhaps in the 20th century, it's still considered iconic.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the internal combustion engine, but that's not in the context.

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

"G-BOAG, G-BOAC, and F-BVFC and the tragic F-BTSC designated what iconic 20thC invention?"

Hmm, perhaps the codes correspond to something else. Maybe the question is referring to the codes as designations for an invention. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cipher or code to find the answer.

Wait, the context mentions that Boulton & Watt's steam engines were a great advance, and their partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines. So perhaps the steam engine is the iconic 20th-century invention, but that's not accurate because it's from the 18th century.

Wait, but the question is about the 20th century. So maybe the answer is the steam turbine, but that's also an earlier invention.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the internal combustion engine, but that's not in the context.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the codes as designations for the steam engine. For example, G-BOAG could stand for something like "Great Britain, Boulton, AG" or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, and the answer is the steam engine, even though it's from the 18th century, because the question is about the 20th-century invention, but maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, the question is about the 20th-century invention, so perhaps the answer is the steam engine, but that's not 20th ['bae aerospatiale concorde', 'f wtsa', 'f bvff', 'aerospatiale bac concorde', 'a√©rospatiale concorde', 'g boaf', 'concorde', 'f wtsb', 'airbus concorde', 'speedbird one', 'concorde sst', 'g boad', 'bae a√©rospatiale concorde', 'aerospatiale bac concorde 206', 'g axdn', 'f bvfb', 'f bvfc', 'f bvfa', 'g boaa', 'f wtss', 'aerospatiale british aerospace concorde', 'bac concorde', 'concorde aeroplane', 'concorde airplane', 'son of concorde', 'g boae', 'concorde plane', 'g boac', 'a√©rospatiale bac concorde', 'g boab', 'g bsst', 'aerospatiale concorde', 'f btsd', 'g boag', 'aerospatiale bac concorde sst', 'f bvfd', 'a√©rospatiale british aerospace concorde']

Okay, so I need to figure out who the inventors are for Penicillin, Television, the Bank of England, the BBC, and the decimal point based on the given context. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with Penicillin. From what I remember, Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming. He noticed that mold had killed bacteria in a petri dish, which led to the development of the antibiotic. The context mentions that Boulton worked with James Watt, but I don't see any direct link to Penicillin here. So, I think the inventor is Alexander Fleming.

Next, Television. The context talks about the Bank of England notes featuring Boulton and Watt, but that's not directly about Television. However, I recall that the invention of the television is credited to John Logie Baird. He was a Scottish inventor who demonstrated the first working television in 1925. So, Television's inventor is John Logie Baird.

Moving on to the Bank of England. The context clearly states that Boulton and Watt are featured on the new ¬£50 note. It mentions that the Bank of England announced this on 29 May 2009. So, the inventors here are Matthew Boulton and James Watt.

Then, the BBC. The BBC is the British Broadcasting Corporation, which was established in 1922. The context doesn't directly mention the BBC, but I know that the BBC was a significant broadcaster, so the inventors would be the people who founded it. The founders were Sir John Reith as the first Director-General, and the initial members included Lord Balfour, Lord Beaverbrook, and Lord Cecil. However, since the question is about the inventors, it's more about the creation of the BBC as an entity, so the inventors would be the individuals who established it, likely Sir John Reith and the others involved in its founding.

Lastly, the decimal point. The decimal system was invented by John Dee, an English mathematician and astronomer. He introduced the decimal point in 1595 in his book "The Compleat Mathematicall". So, the inventor is John Dee.

Wait, but the context provided doesn't mention any of these people except Boulton and Watt. So, I need to make sure I'm not confusing the context. The context is about Boulton and Watt's contributions, but the question is about other inventors. So, I should rely on general knowledge for these.

Putting it all together, the inventors are:

Penicillin: Alexander Fleming

Television: John Logie Baird

Bank of England: Matthew Boulton and James Watt

BBC: Sir John Reith and the initial members

Decimal Point: John Dee

I think that's correct. Let me double-check each one to make sure.

Penicillin - yes, Fleming.

Television - Baird. ['scotish', 'scottish disambiguation', 'scottish']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: British Columbia's capital is Victoria, located at the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island. Only a narrow strip of the Island, from Comox to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick, tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest.

British Columbia, (commonly referred to by its initials BC), is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than 4 million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. 
British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.   The province's name was chosen in 1858 by members of the Hudson's Bay Company.

The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada, named for the Queen who created the Colony of British Columbia. The largest city is Vancouver, the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada, the largest in Western Canada, and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest. In October 2013, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 (about 2.5 million of whom were in Greater Vancouver).  The province is currently governed by the BC

British Columbia is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west side, by the American state of Alaska to the northwest and parts of the west, on the north by Yukon and the Northwest Territories, on the east by the province of Alberta, and on the south by the states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The current southern border of British Columbia was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as California. British Columbia's land area is 944735

With the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the colonial office to formally designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia, the first Lieutenant-Governor of which, from 1858 to 1863,
was Richard Clement Moody, who had previously served as the first Governor of the Falkland Islands. Moody was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west", ‚Äúto found a second England on the shores of the Pacific‚Äù.



Question: What regal name is capital of Seychelles, and British Columbia (Canada), and is an Australian state? 

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Question: What regal name is capital of Seychelles, and British Columbia (Canada), and is an Australian state?

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

It's asking for the regal name (royal name) of the capital of Seychelles, British Columbia (Canada), and also a capital that is an Australian state.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

Question: What regal name is capital of Seychelles, and British Columbia (Canada), and is an Australian state?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it.

It's asking for the "regal name" (royal name) of the capital of Seychelles, British Columbia (Canada), and also, that same name is the capital of an Australian state.

Wait, no. Let me read it again.

Question: What regal name is capital of Seychelles, and British Columbia (Canada), and is an Australian state?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the name of the capital that is both the capital of Seychelles, the capital of British Columbia (Canada), and also the capital of an Australian state.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because Seychelles is a separate country, and British Columbia is a province in Canada. So, the capital of Seychelles is Victoria, the capital of British Columbia is also Victoria, and the capital of an Australian state that is Victoria? Wait, no, because in Australia, the states are: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory. The capital of Victoria is Melbourne. So, perhaps the question is trying to find a capital that is the same for both Seychelles and British Columbia, and also is the capital of an Australian state.

Wait, but the capital of Seychelles is Victoria, and the capital of British Columbia is also Victoria. So, the regal name is Victoria. Now, is Victoria the capital of an Australian state? Yes, Victoria is a state in Australia, and its capital is Melbourne. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the capital of the state of Victoria is Melbourne. So, the capital of the state of Victoria is Melbourne, not Victoria. So, perhaps the question is trying to find a capital that is the same for both Seychelles and British Columbia, and also is the capital of an Australian state. But in that case, the capital would have to be the same for all three, but the capitals are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the question again.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Famous Five is the name of a series of children's adventure novels written by English author Enid Blyton. The first book, Five on a Treasure Island, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children¬†‚Äì Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George)¬†‚Äì and their dog Timmy.

Beginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.

Parodies

Blyton was a nature writer early in her career, and the books are strongly atmospheric, with a detailed but idealised presentation of the rural southern English landscape. The books present children exploring this landscape without parental supervision as natural and normal. Pete Cash of the English Association has noted that the children, "are allowed to go off on their own to an extent that today would contravene the Child Protection Act (1999) and interest Social Services."

The stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective boarding schools. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in Dorset, such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay.  In some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. The

# F√ºnf Freunde auf der verbotenen Insel ("Five Friends on the Forbidden Island") (1977)
# F√ºnf Freunde und der blaue Diamant ("Five Friends and the Blue Diamond") (1979)
Although Enid Blyton is named as author on the cover, the books were most likely written by German author Brigitte Blobel, who is credited as the translator. The books were recalled after the first edition owing to copyright issues, and are now rare and high-priced collector's items.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The bonnethead shark or shovelhead, Sphyrna tiburo, is a member of the hammerhead shark genus Sphyrna, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. The Greek word sphyrna translates as hammer, referring to the shape of this shark's head; tiburo is the Taino word for shark.

Appearance

Characterized by a broad, smooth, spade-like head, they have the smallest cephalofoil (hammerhead) of all Sphyrna. Grey-brown above and lighter on the underside, it is a timid and a harmless shark.

SizeOn average, bonnethead sharks are about 2 - long, with a maximum size of about 5 feet (150 cm), with female Bonnethead sharks being larger than males.

Habitat

The bonnethead shark is an active tropical shark that swims in small groups of 5 to 15 individuals.  Curiously however, schools of hundreds or even thousands have been reported. Bonnethead sharks move constantly following changes in water temperature and to maintain respiration.  The bonnethead shark will sink if it does not keep moving since hammerhead sharks are among the most negatively buoyant of marine vertebrates.  The bonnethead shark uses a unique type of cerebrospinal fluid to let

Bonnethead sharks are the only sharks known to exhibit sexual dimorphism; that is, male and female adults look different from one another. In morphology, adult female bonnethead sharks have a broadly rounded head, whereas males possess a distinct bulge along the anterior margin of the cephalofoil. This bulge is formed by the elongation of the rostral cartilages of the males at the onset of sexual maturity and corresponds temporally with the elongation of the clasper cartilages.

Evolution

Using data from mtDNA analysis, scientist have found that evolution of hammerhead sharks has probably begun with a taxon that had a highly pronounced cephalofoil (most likely that similar to the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii), and has later been modified through selective pressures. It is thus assumed today that, judging by their smaller cephalofoil, bonnethead sharks are the more recent developments of a 25 million year evolutionary process.

To accommodate the many types of animals that it feeds on, the bonnethead shark has small, sharp teeth in the front of the mouth (for grabbing soft prey) and flat, broad molars in the back (for crushing hard-shelled prey).

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Die Hard 2 (sometimes referred to as Die Hard 2: Die Harder)  is a 1990 American action film and the second in the Die Hard film series. It was released on July 4, 1990. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film co-stars Bonnie Bedelia (reprising her role as Holly McClane), William Sadler, Art Evans, William Atherton (reprising his role as Richard "Dick" Thornburg), Franco Nero, Dennis Franz, Fred Thompson, John Amos, and Reginald VelJohnson,returning briefly in his role as Sgt. Al Powell from the first film.

Die Hard 2 was the first film to use digitally composited live-action footage with a traditional matte painting that had been photographed and scanned into a computer. It was used for the last scene, which took place on a runway.

The screenplay was written by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson, adapted from Walter Wager's novel 58 Minutes. The novel has the same premise but differs slightly: A cop must stop terrorists who take an airport hostage while his wife's plane circles overhead. He has 58 minutes to do so before the plane crashes. Roderick Thorp, who wrote the novel Nothing Lasts Forever, upon which Die Hard was based, receives credit for creating "certain original characters", although his name is misspelledonscreen as "Roderick Thorpe".

Reception

Box office

The film exceeded all expectations by actually outdoing the massive box office success of Die Hard.  The film had a budget of US$70 million and had a wide release in 2,507 theaters, making $21.7 million its opening weekend. Die Hard 2 has domestically made $117.5 million and $239.5 million worldwide, almost doubling that of Die Hard.

Critical reception

Die Hard 2 received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 69% "Fresh" rating based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The critical consensus reads, "It lacks the fresh thrills of its predecessor, but Die Hard 2 still works as an over-the-top ‚Äì and reasonably taut ‚Äì big-budget sequel, with plenty of set pieces to paper over the plot deficiencies".  Roger Ebert, who gave the original film a negative review, described the sequel as "terrific



Question: "What song plays over the closing credits of ""Die Hard"" (1988)?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out what song plays over the closing credits of "Die Hard" (1988). I remember that "Die Hard" is a classic action movie, and its sequel, "Die Hard 2," came out later. But the question is specifically about the first movie, "Die Hard."

I think the song over the closing credits is something memorable. I recall that the end of "Die Hard" has a pretty famous song. Wait, wasn't there a song that became a big hit after the movie? Oh right, I think it's "Walked in the Rain" by the Pointer Sisters. Or was it another song? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up with another movie. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: "Let's All Party" by the Pointer Sisters? Or maybe "I'll Be Home for Christmas" by John Lennon? No, that's more of a Christmas song. Alternatively, could it be "The First Time I Saw Your Face"? No, that's from another movie, maybe "The Thomas Crown Affair."

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing it. Let me try to recall. The song that plays during the closing credits of "Die Hard" is "Let's All Party" by the Pointer Sisters. Or was it "I'm Gonna Make It Big" by the same group? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the song that really stuck in my mind from "Die Hard" is "Let's All Party." Or maybe it's "I'm Gonna Make It Big." I think the Pointer Sisters have a song that's featured in the movie. Alternatively, perhaps it's "I'm a Thief" by the same group? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to remember. The song that plays over the closing credits of "Die Hard" is "Let's All Party" by the Pointer Sisters. Or was it "I'm Gonna Make It Big"? I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific scene. In the movie, when the credits start rolling, what song is playing? I think it's "Let's All Party." Or maybe it's "I'm Gonna Make It Big." I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's one of those songs.

Alternatively, maybe it's "I'm a Thief" by the Pointer Sisters. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to think of the movie's key moments. There's a scene where John McClane is on the roof, and then the song starts playing as the credits roll. I think the song is "Let's All Party."

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to ['let it snow', 'let it snow let it snow let it snow', 'let it snow let it snoe let it snow', 'let it snow let it snow let it snow jessica simpson single']

Primeval primes

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. By Euclid's theorem, there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Subsets of the prime numbers may be generated with various formulas for primes. The first 1000 primes are listed below, followed by lists of notable types of prime numbers in alphabetical order, giving their respective first terms.

Question: If you divide a prime number by 4, the Answer must result in ? 

Okay, so I need to figure out what happens when you divide a prime number by 4. Hmm, let's think about prime numbers first. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Now, the question is about dividing a prime by 4. Let me consider different primes and see what happens. Let's take the smallest primes first.

Take 2: 2 divided by 4 is 0.5. But 0.5 isn't an integer, and primes are integers. So, maybe the result isn't an integer. Let's try another prime. How about 3? 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. Again, not an integer. Next, 5 divided by 4 is 1.25. Still not an integer. 7 divided by 4 is 1.75. Not an integer either. 

Wait, what about 7? 7 divided by 4 is 1.75. Not an integer. So, so far, none of these primes when divided by 4 give an integer. Let me check a larger prime. Let's say 11: 11 divided by 4 is 2.75. Still not an integer. 

Wait a minute, maybe I should think about the possible remainders when a prime is divided by 4. Since primes are either 2 or odd numbers, and 2 is the only even prime. So, for primes greater than 2, they are odd, meaning when divided by 2, they leave a remainder of 1. So, when divided by 4, an odd number can leave a remainder of 1 or 3.

Let me test that. Take 3: 3 divided by 4 is 0 with a remainder of 3. 5 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 1. 7 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 3. 9 isn't prime, but 11 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 3. So, the possible remainders are 1 or 3.

So, when you divide a prime by 4, the remainder can be either 1 or 3. But the question is asking what the answer must result in. So, the result can't be an integer because the remainder is either 1 or 3. Therefore, the result isn't an integer, but a fraction.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the Answer must result in ?" So, perhaps the answer is that dividing a prime by 4 doesn't result in an integer, but a fraction. But the options might be more specific.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the possible remainders. But ['fractional', 'fraction', 'fraction disambiguation', 'fraction quantity']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: A whole note lasts half as long as a double whole note (or breve‚Äîhence the British name, semibreve), and twice as long as a half note, or minim. The symbol is first found in music notation from the late thirteenth century .

Figure 1. A whole note and a whole rest.

In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head, like a half note (or minim), and no note stem (see Figure 1). Its length is equal to four beats in 4/4 time, that is the whole 4/4 measure (or bar). Most other notes are fractions of the whole note; half notes are played for one half the duration of the whole note, quarter notes (or crotchets) are each played for one quarter the duration, etc.

The Catalan, French and Spanish names for the note (meaning "round") derive from the fact that the semibrevis was distinguished by its round stemless shape, which is true as well of the modern form (in contrast to the double whole note or shorter values with stems). The Greek name means "whole". Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese names mean "whole note".

A related symbol is the whole rest (or semibreve rest), which usually denotes a silence for the same duration. Whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles generally hanging under the second line from the top of a musical staff, though they may occasionally be put under a different line in more complicated passages, such as when two instruments or vocalists are written on one staff, and one is temporarily silent.

Other lengths

The whole note and whole rest may also be used in music of free rhythm, such as Anglican chant, to denote a whole measure, irrespective of the time of that measure. The whole rest can be used this way in almost all or all forms of music.

Etymology

The whole note derives from the semibrevis of mensural notation, and this is the origin of the British name. The American name is a calque of the German ganze Note.

The names of this note (and rest) in different languages vary greatly:



Question: What is the name of the note that is 1/8 the length of a semi-breve? Or, in other words, what is the smallest note in Western music notation?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "What is the name of the note that is 1/8 the length of a semi-breve? Or, in other words, what is the smallest note in Western music notation?" 

First, I'll look at the context provided. The context mentions that a whole note lasts half as long as a double whole note (or breve) and twice as long as a half note or minim. It also states that the whole note is equal to four beats in 4/4 time, which means it's the duration of a full bar. 

The context goes on to explain that other notes are fractions of the whole note. It specifically mentions half notes, which are half the duration of the whole note, and quarter notes (or crotchets), which are a quarter of the whole note's duration. So, if a whole note is four beats, a quarter note would be one beat.

The question is asking for the smallest note, which would be the one that's 1/8 the length of a semi-breve (which is the British term for a whole note). Since a whole note is four beats, a semi-breve is the same as a whole note. So, 1/8 of that would be 0.125 beats. But in terms of note names, the smallest note in Western notation is the 32nd note, also known as the demisemibreve. 

Wait, but the context mentions that the whole note is twice as long as a half note or minim. So, if a whole note is four beats, a half note is two beats, a quarter note is one beat, and then the eighth note would be half a beat, which is a 32nd note. However, in the context, the smallest note mentioned is the quarter note, which is a crotchet. But the question is about the smallest, which is the 32nd note.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention the 32nd note. It only goes down to the quarter note. So perhaps the context is limiting the information. But the question is about the smallest note in Western notation, which is the 32nd note, or demisemibreve. 

Wait, but the context says that the whole note is twice as long as a half note, which is a minim. So, a whole note is four beats, a half note is two, a quarter is one. So, the next smaller note would be an eighth note, which is half a beat, but the context doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the context is only providing information up to the quarter note, but the question is about the smallest, which is the 32nd note.

Wait, but the context mentions that the whole note is the same as four beats, and ['achtel note', 'demi soupir', 'croche', 'eighth note', '√•ttondelsnot', 'eighth part note', '‚ô™', 'ùÑæ', 'corchea', 'quaver', '‚ô´', '8th note', 'eighth notes', 'attondelsnot']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Personal names in German-speaking Europe consist of one or several given names (Vorname, plural Vornamen) and a surname (Nachname, Familienname)
The Vorname is usually gender-specific. A name is usually cited in the "Western order" of "given name, surname", unless it occurs in an alphabetized list of surnames, e.g. "Bach, Johann Sebastian".

Also, the spelling of given and surnames, varying previously from author to author, or even entry to entry, was then mostly fixed according to the official recorded form. Former noble titles appearing in male and female variants were transformed by the Weimar Constitution, article 109, into parts of the surnames in Germany, but  a new tradition of gender-specific variants, for official registration, was established for these surnames. This practice was confirmed in a judgement by theReichsgericht on 10 March 1926.

Surnames (family name; Nachname, Familienname) were gradually introduced in German-speaking Europe during the Late Middle Ages. Many of such surnames are derived from nicknames. They are generally classified into four groups by  derivation: 
given names, job designations, bodily attributes, and toponyms (including references to named buildings). Also, many family names display characteristic features of the dialect of the region they originated in.

Colloquially, surname variants for women continue to appear in some German dialects. In Bavarian dialect surnames of women sometimes are formed by adding the ending "-in", used in standard High German to indicate noun variants for women or items of grammatical feminine gender, such as N√§herin (seamstress), with N√§her (seamster) being the male form. In West Low German parlance the ending "‚Ä¶sch(e)" is sometimes added to surnames of women, related to the standard High German adjective ending

As of 2012, the top ten given names of Baden-W√ºrttemberg (Southern Germany) and of Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany) share the entries Ben, Paul, Finn, Luca, Max (male), Mia, Emma, Lea, Leonie, Anna, Lena, Hanna, while Schleswig-Holstein retains the traditionally northern (Low German) forms Lasse (male) and Neele (female) in the top ten.The following table gives the most popular given names in Germany per decade (since 1890),

Question: In the International Radio Alphabet, how many are traditional male given names in German-speaking countries?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many traditional male given names in German-speaking countries are part of the International Radio Alphabet. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the International Radio Alphabet (IRA) is a set of 26 letters, each assigned to a specific sound. It's used in radio communication to represent letters without ambiguity. The letters are assigned based on their pronunciation, not their spelling.

Now, the question is about traditional male given names in German-speaking countries. So I should think about common male names in Germany, Austria, and other German-speaking regions. Names like Hans, Fritz, G√ºnter, etc. But wait, the question specifies "traditional" male names. So I'm looking for names that have been commonly used traditionally, not newer names that might have come about later.

Next, I need to see which of these names are part of the IRA. The IRA includes letters from the English alphabet, but each letter is assigned a unique phonetic symbol. So I need to check if the traditional male names are included in the IRA.

I recall that the IRA includes all 26 letters of the English alphabet, so any English name would be included. But wait, the question is about traditional male names in German-speaking countries. So I should list some traditional male German names and then check if they are in the IRA.

Let me think of some traditional male German names: Hans, Fritz, G√ºnter, Wolfgang, Heinz, Horst, Dieter, etc. Now, each of these names is an English word, so their letters are included in the English alphabet, which is part of the IRA. Therefore, each of these names would be represented in the IRA.

Wait, but the question is asking how many are in the IRA, not which ones. So I need to know how many traditional male given names in German-speaking countries are part of the IRA. Since the IRA includes all 26 letters, any traditional male name would be included because their letters are part of the English alphabet.

But wait, the question might be implying how many of the traditional male names are specifically included in the IRA, not just any. Since the IRA includes all letters, the answer would be that all of them are included. However, the question might be more about how many letters in the traditional names are part of the IRA, but that doesn't make sense because the IRA includes all letters.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking how many traditional male given names in German-speaking countries are part of the IRA. Since the IRA includes all 26 letters, any traditional male name would be included because their letters are part of the English alphabet. Therefore, the number would be equal to the number of such names that are in the IRA, which is all of them.

But the question is phrased as "how many are traditional male given names in German-speaking ['five', '5']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: One notable change in the film involved the opening titles. Concerned that a roaring Leo the Lion (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet.  It was the first time in MGM history that the lion logo was not seen roaring.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) originally announced a remake of the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur in December 1952, ostensibly as a way to spend its Italian assets.  Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced it would make the film in CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954.  In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it.  Zimbalist was

R√≥zsa arranged his score into a "Ben-Hur Suite", which was released on Lion Records (an MGM subsidiary which issued low-priced records) in 1959.  This made the Ben-Hur film musical score the first to be released not only in its entirety but also as a separate album.

a two-CD set in 1991.   Rhino Records issued a two-CD release in 1996 which featured remastered original recordings, outtakes from the original film soundtrack, alternate and recording outtakes, and extended versions of some musical sequences. In 2012, Film Score Monthly and WaterTower Music issued a limited edition five-CD set of music from the film.  It included a remastered film score (as heard on screen) on two discs; two discs of alternate versions, additional alternate versions, andunused tracks (presented in film order); and the contents of the three-LP MGM and one-LP Lion Records albums on a single disc.Chariot race sequence

By the late 1950s, court decisions forcing film studios to divest themselves of theater chains  and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM.  In a gamble to save the studio, and inspired by the success of Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur.  Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took

Wait, the context doesn't mention Metro Pictures taking over companies to form MGM. It talks about MGM's history in making Ben-Hur, including the lion logo.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: regardless of type). Another study ranked several drinks by their ability to cause a hangover (from low to high): distilled ethanol diluted with fruit juice, beer, vodka, gin, white wine, whisky, rum, red wine and brandy.

Recommendations for foods, drinks and activities to relieve hangover symptoms abound. The ancient Romans, on the authority of Pliny the Elder, favored raw owl's eggs or fried canary,  while the "prairie oyster" restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, calls for raw egg yolk mixed with Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper. By 1938, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel provided a hangover remedy in the form of a mixture of Coca-Cola and milk  (Coca-Cola itself having been

invented, by some accounts,   as a hangover remedy). Alcoholic writer Ernest Hemingway relied on tomato juice and beer.  Other purported hangover cures include cocktails such as Bloody Mary or Black Velvet (consisting of equal parts champagne and stout).  A 1957 survey by a Wayne State University folklorist found widespread belief in the efficacy of heavy fried foods, tomato juice and sexual activity.Other untested or discredited treatments include:

Though many possible remedies and "folk cures" have been suggested, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover.

exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to avoid drinking."  Most remedies do not significantly reduce overall hangover severity. Some compounds reduce specific symptoms such as vomiting and headache, but are not effective in reducing other common hangover symptoms such as drowsiness and fatiguePotentially beneficial



Question: What name is given to an alcoholic drink that is taken in an effort to cure a hangover? (Choose from the options: Prairie Oyster, Black Velvet, Bloody Mary, Ritz-Carlton remedy, or Coca-Cola and milk)
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "What name is given to an alcoholic drink that is taken in an effort to cure a hangover?" The options are Prairie Oyster, Black Velvet, Bloody Mary, Ritz-Carlton remedy, or Coca-Cola and milk.

First, I'll read through the context provided to understand the information given. The context talks about various hangover remedies, mentioning several drinks and their components. It starts by listing different drinks based on their ability to cause hangovers, but then moves on to discuss remedies.

The context mentions the "prairie oyster" restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, which involves raw egg yolk mixed with Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt, and pepper. Then it talks about the Ritz-Carlton Hotel providing a remedy with Coca-Cola and milk. It also mentions Ernest Hemingway relying on tomato juice and beer, and other cures like Bloody Mary or Black Velvet, which is a mixture of champagne and stout.

The context also notes that while many remedies are suggested, there's no compelling evidence they're effective. The most effective way is to avoid alcohol or drink in moderation.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match each option to the names mentioned in the context.

- Prairie Oyster: This is explicitly mentioned as a remedy, introduced at the Paris World Exposition.
- Black Velvet: This is mentioned as a cocktail, specifically equal parts champagne and stout.
- Bloody Mary: This is also mentioned as a purported hangover cure, typically a mix of tomato juice and vodka.
- Ritz-Carlton remedy: The context says the Ritz-Carlton provided a remedy of Coca-Cola and milk.
- Coca-Cola and milk: This is directly mentioned as a remedy provided by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.

So, the question is asking for the name of an alcoholic drink used to cure a hangover. All the options except one are actual names of drinks used as remedies. The Ritz-Carlton remedy is a specific mixture, but the question is about the name given to the drink, not the remedy itself. Wait, no, the Ritz-Carlton remedy is a specific drink, but the question is about the name. Let me check again.

Wait, the Ritz-Carlton remedy is a mixture of Coca-Cola and milk, but the question is about the name of the drink. So, the Ritz-Carlton remedy is a remedy, not a specific drink name. The other options are specific drink names used as remedies.

Wait, the question is asking for the name given to an alcoholic drink used to cure a hangover. So, the options are names of drinks. The Ritz-Carlton ['hair of dog that bit you', 'alcohol readministration', 'hair of dog', 'hair off dogs back', 'recovery drinking']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is a  complex of buildings in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It hosts many notable performing arts organizations, which are nationally and internationally renowned, including the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, and the New York City Ballet.

Planning

Rockefeller was Lincoln Center's inaugural president from 1956 and became its chairman in 1961. He is credited with raising more than half of the $184.5 million in private funds needed to build the complex, including drawing on his own funds; the Rockefeller Brothers Fund also contributed to the project.  The center's three buildings, David Geffen Hall (formerly Avery Fisher Hall), David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater) and the Metropolitan Opera House were opened in 1962,1964 and 1966, respectively.

*October 19, 1976: Avery Fisher Hall re-opened after renovation to improve acoustics.
*December 4, 1981: The Big Apple Circus performed at its winter home in Damrosch Park for the first time. The circus has performed every winter at Lincoln Center ever since.
*September 7, 1982: New York State Theater re-opened after renovation to improve acoustics.

*April 23, 1964: New York State Theater opened.
*October 14, 1965: Vivian Beaumont Theater and the Forum (now Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater) opened.
*November 30, 1965: The Library & Museum of the Performing Arts opened.
*September 16, 1966: The Metropolitan Opera House opened.
*May 22, 1969: Damrosch Park and the Guggenheim Band Shell opened.
*September 11, 1969: Alice Tully Hall opened.
*October 26, 1969: Juilliard School opened.

A consortium of civic leaders and others led by, and under the initiative of, John D. Rockefeller III built Lincoln Center as part of the "Lincoln Square Renewal Project" during Robert Moses's program of urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s.  Respected architects were contracted to design the major buildings on the site, and over the next thirty years the previously blighted area around Lincoln Center became a new cultural hub.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Bismarck is the capital of the U.S. state of North Dakota and the county seat of Burleigh County.   It is the second most populous city in North Dakota after Fargo. The city's population was 61,272 at the 2010 census,  while its metropolitan population was 129,517. In 2015, Forbes magazine ranked Bismarck as the seventh fastest-growing small city in the United States.

Bismarck was founded in 1872 and has been North Dakota's capital city since the state was created from the Dakota Territory and admitted to the Union in 1889.

Bismarck is on the east bank of the Missouri River, directly across the river from Mandan.  The two cities make up the core of the Bismarck-Mandan Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Geography

Bismarck is located at  (46.813343, -100.779004). 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which,  is land and  is water.

Cityscape

Before the arrival of white settlers, present-day central North Dakota was inhabited by the Mandan Native American tribe.  The Hidatsa name of Bismarck is mirahacii arumaaguash ("Place of the tall willows");  the Arikara name is ituhta√°we [itUhta√°we].  In 1872 the future capital city was founded at what was then called Missouri Crossing, so named because  the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed the river there. The new town was called Edwinton, after Edwin Ferry Johnson (1803‚Äì1872),

Hunting and fishing are popular with hunting seasons for deer, pheasant, and waterfowl. Fishing is a year-round sport on the Missouri River bordering Bismarck. There are public docks on the river. From north to south, there is a dock at the Port of Bismarck, from which the Lewis and Clark passenger riverboat plies the Missouri; Fox Island Landing, about a half mile southwest of Riverwood Golf Course; and the Bismarck Dock at General Sibley Park, where there is a boat ramp and picnic facilities.



Question: If you travelled down the Missouri River from Bismarck, North Dakota, which city would you be in when you reached the ocean? Well, the Missouri River doesn't flow into the ocean; it flows into the Mississippi River, which then flows into the Gulf of Mexico. So, if you traveled down the Missouri River from Bismarck, you would end up in the Mississippi River, not the ocean. But the question is phrased as if the river flows into the ocean, so perhaps the intended answer is New Orleans, which is on the Mississippi River. Alternatively, if considering the ocean the river flows into, it's the Gulf of Mexico, but the nearest ocean is the Gulf of Mexico, not the Atlantic or Pacific. So, the answer would be New Orleans or perhaps the Gulf of Mexico, but since the question mentions the ocean, the intended answer is New Orleans.

But wait, the context says that Bismarck is on the east bank of the Missouri River, directly across from Mandan. So, traveling down the Missouri from Bismarck would take you towards Mandan, but Mandan is on the other side. Wait, no, the river flows from north to south, so from Bismarck, going down the Missouri would take you towards the south, towards the Mandan area, but Mandan is on the west side? Wait, no, the context says Bismarck is on the east bank, so traveling down the river from Bismarck would take you further south, towards the south, towards the Mandan area, but Mandan is on the west side? Wait, no, the context says Bismarck is on the east bank, directly across from Mandan.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: √âdouard Manet ( or;; 23 January 1832 ‚Äì 30 April 1883) was a French painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.

From 1853 to 1856, Manet visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter Frans Hals, and the Spanish artists Diego Vel√°zquez and Francisco Jos√© de Goya.

Career

Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's

Manet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, "only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" by offended viewers.  The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her

At his father's suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to Rio de Janeiro. After he twice failed the examination to join the Navy,  his father relented to his wishes to pursue an art education. From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture. In his spare time, Manet copied the Old Masters in the Louvre.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "The Fear" is a song by British recording artist Lily Allen from her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You (2009). Written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, the song was released as the lead single of the album. Initially, "Everyone's at It" was announced to be the first single from the album. However, it was ultimately decided on "The Fear" to be released on 26 January 2009 by Regal Recordings, while the demo (which was then titled "I Don't Know") leaked onto the Internet in April 2008. The song

In the United Kingdom, "The Fear" debuted at number 168 on the UK Singles Chart on 25 January 2009 ‚Äï for the week ending dated 31 January 2009. The following week, the song climbed 167 places to reach number one, thwarting Lady Gaga's "Just Dance" from the summit of the chart. Gaga commented on this, saying "I'm very familiar with Lily's music and good job Lily for knocking me off. There always deserves to be a female on top and I don't want to be the only one to do it. I think generally that

Contemporary critics complimented the song and its themes of consumerism and the postmodern condition. "The Fear" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for four weeks. The single peaked also inside the top 20 of the charts of some European countries and Australia. It is also Allen's second chart entry in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

incorporates electropop music as the lyrics articulate problems with celebrity lifestyles and include metaphors for recognised tabloid national newspapers such as The Sun. "The Fear" also references, albeit indirectly, the Great Depression of the 1930s.

pop music is making an enormous comeback and I'm actually very pleased with Lily Allen's new record as it's decidedly pop".  The song managed to remain on top for four weeks, throughout the whole of February, until it was dethroned by Kelly Clarkson's "My Life Would Suck Without You".  It thus earned Allen's second chart-topper, since her debut single, "Smile", achieved the feat in July 2006.  "The Fear" also became the single which spent more weeks atop the chart of 2009 in the UK. On the



Question: "Which album by Lily Allen contained the tracks ""The Fear"", ""Not Fair"" and ""22""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out which album by Lily Allen contains the tracks "The Fear," "Not Fair," and "22." Let me start by recalling what I know about Lily Allen's discography. I remember that she has released a few albums, and her second studio album was "It's Not Me, It's You." That came out in 2009, I think. 

Looking at the context provided, it mentions that "The Fear" is a song from her second studio album, "It's Not Me, It's You." So that's one track. The question also includes "Not Fair" and "22." I believe "Not Fair" is another track from that same album. 

Wait, I should double-check. The context says that "The Fear" was released on her second studio album, which is "It's Not Me, It's You." It also mentions that "The Fear" was the lead single from that album. So that's one track. 

What about "Not Fair"? I think that's also from the same album. I'm trying to remember the songs from that era. "Not Fair" is another track from "It's Not Me, It's You." 

And "22"? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about that one. I think "22" might be from her third album, but wait, the context doesn't mention "22" in the provided text. Wait, no, the context does mention "22" in the same paragraph. Let me check again. 

Wait, the context says that "The Fear" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and mentions "Not Fair" as another track. But it doesn't explicitly say where "22" is from. Wait, no, the context actually says that "The Fear" is from her second studio album, but "22" isn't mentioned in the context. Wait, no, the context does mention "22" in the same context. Let me read again.

Wait, the context says: "The song incorporates electropop music... 'The Fear' also references, albeit indirectly, the Great Depression of the 1930s." Then later, it says "It thus earned Allen's second chart-topper..." and "On the..." Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the context provided is a bit lengthy. Let me read through it carefully. The first part talks about the song being from her second album, "It's Not Me, It's You." It mentions "The Fear" being the lead single, released in January 2009. Then it goes on to talk about the song's success in the UK, peaking at number one, and mentions that "The Fear" earned her second chart-topper. 

Wait, the context also mentions that "The Fear" was her second chart entry in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. So, ['its not me its you', 'everyone s at it', 'stuck on naughty steps', 'everyone s at it song', 'it s not me it s you', 'stuck on naughty step', 'fuck you tour']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.  The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world  and is the most popular sports league in the United States.  The

A new professional league, the fourth American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl, was held four times before the merger,

Today, the NFL is considered the most popular sports league in North America; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million viewers watched 1989's Super Bowl XXIII. The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties earns the league billions of

and employees. He is the "principal executive officer" of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league bylaws or committed "conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football". The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, handdown a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.



Question: What team does controversial quarterback Michael Vick play for in the National Football League in the USA? 

Okay, so I need to figure out which team Michael Vick plays for in the NFL. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael Vick. I remember he was involved in some controversy a few years back, maybe related to dogfighting? Yeah, that's right. He was a quarterback for an NFL team, but there was a legal issue that led to him being suspended or something.

Now, the question is about his current team. I think he's been with a few teams. Let me think. After his suspension, he might have played for the Philadelphia Eagles. Wait, was that before or after? I think he was with the Eagles but then got suspended, so he might have moved on. Or did he stay with them?

Wait, another thought: the Eagles are in the NFC, right? So if the context mentions the NFL's conferences, the Eagles are in the NFC. But the question is about the team he plays for now. I'm not entirely sure, but I think he's been with the Eagles for a while. Maybe after his suspension, he came back to them?

Alternatively, I might be confusing him with another quarterback. Let me try to piece it together. I think he played for the Falcons initially, but that was before his legal troubles. Then he was with the Eagles, and after his suspension, he might have been released or something. Wait, no, I think he's still with the Eagles as of recent years, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the context provided mentions the NFL's structure, conferences, and some information about the league's history and current standing. It doesn't directly mention Michael Vick, though. So I might have to rely on general knowledge.

I think Michael Vick is currently with the Philadelphia Eagles. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe he's with another team now. Wait, I think he was with the Eagles from 2001 to 2006, but then had legal issues, was suspended, and then perhaps came back later. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline.

Wait, another angle: the context says the NFL has the highest average attendance and is the most popular in the US. It also mentions the Super Bowl and the commissioner's role. But nothing about Vick.

So, perhaps I should go with the most recent information I have. I think Michael Vick is currently a free agent or perhaps with the Eagles again after his suspension. Wait, no, I think he's with the Eagles but had some issues. Alternatively, maybe he's with the Pittsburgh Steelers? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think step by step. Michael Vick was a star quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, but then got involved in dogfighting, which led to him being suspended by the NFL. After that, he was with the Philadelphia Eagles, but I think he was released or something.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "Thank You" is a song written and performed by English singer-songwriter Dido. The song, released on her 1999 debut studio album, No Angel, made its first appearance in 1998, on the soundtrack of Sliding Doors, although it was not released as a single until late 2000. It was later featured on Dido's debut album, No Angel, becoming the album's biggest hit. The song's first verse is notably used as the chorus in the song "Stan" by Eminem. 

Song information

Dido wrote the song as a tribute to her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Bob Page. They got engaged in 2001 but their split the following year inspired "White Flag," which features on Dido's second album Life for Rent, and is about their split. It remains Dido's biggest hit single in the US to date, and her only one to reach the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.

Eminem's critically acclaimed single "Stan" samples the first verse of the song for its chorus. Dido herself appears in the music video for "Stan" and has made appearances on Eminem's tours to perform the song. When Eminem performed "Stan" live at the 2001 Grammy Awards, Elton John sang the Dido sample as he played keyboard during the performance.

Deep Dish version

The house duo Deep Dish remixed the song. It won a Grammy Award for "Best Remixed Recording" in 2002.

Syke's "Dear Kuya"

The song is written in the key of B major with a tempo of 80 beats per minute in common time.  It follows a chord progression of GmEmaj7FBF/A, and Dido's vocals span from F3 to B4 in the song. 
Eminem's "Stan"

"Thank You" reached a peak position of #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 2001, becoming Dido's first and only top three single in the United States. In the United Kingdom, "Thank You" also reached a peak position of #3, becoming the singer's third top three single from No Angel in the United Kingdom. It was Dido's biggest single in the United Kingdom, until the release of "White Flag."



Question: "Dido was ""featured"" on the song ""Sam"", which was written and performed by whom?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out who wrote and performed the song "Sam" where Dido was featured. Let me look through the context provided.

The context talks about "Thank You" being a song by Dido, written for her boyfriend Bob Page. It mentions that "Stan" by Eminem uses the first verse of "Thank You" as its chorus. Dido appears in the music video for "Stan" and has performed on Eminem's tours. So, Eminem performed "Stan" at the 2001 Grammy Awards, with Elton John singing the Dido sample.

Wait, the question is about "Sam," not "Stan." Hmm. The context doesn't explicitly mention "Sam." Let me check again. The context discusses "Thank You," "Stan," and the Deep Dish remix, but not "Sam." So, maybe "Sam" is another song by Eminem that features Dido? Or perhaps it's a typo, and they meant "Stan." But the question specifically says "Sam."

Wait, the context says that Dido wrote "Thank You" as a tribute to Bob Page. It also mentions that "Stan" by Eminem uses the first verse of "Thank You." So, Eminem's "Stan" features Dido's vocals. But the question is about "Sam," which isn't mentioned here. Maybe "Sam" is another song where Dido is featured. Alternatively, perhaps "Sam" is a typo, and the intended song is "Stan," but the question says "Sam."

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The context doesn't mention "Sam," so maybe the answer isn't provided here. But the question is asking based on the context given. Since the context only talks about "Thank You," "Stan," and the Deep Dish remix, perhaps "Sam" isn't in there. But the question is about "Sam," so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the context says that Dido's "Thank You" was featured on the soundtrack of "Sliding Doors" in 1998, and later on her album. It also mentions that "Stan" by Eminem uses the first verse of "Thank You." So, Eminem's "Stan" features Dido. But the question is about "Sam," which isn't mentioned. So, perhaps the answer isn't provided in the context, but the question is prompting me to infer. Alternatively, maybe "Sam" is another song by Eminem that features Dido, but it's not mentioned here.

Wait, the context doesn't mention "Sam," so perhaps the answer isn't in the context. But the question is asking based on the provided context. So, maybe the answer isn't there, but the question expects me to find it. Alternatively, perhaps "Sam" is a typo, and the intended song is "Stan," but the question says "Sam."

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Soviet Union (), officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (), abbreviated to USSR (), was a socialist state on the Eurasian continent that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.

In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism‚ÄìLeninism with capitalism.

Communists take power through soviets, which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants. In 1922, the Communists were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule, committed the state ideology to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism (which he created), and

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the

Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period of political and economic liberalization, known as "de-Stalinization" and "Khrushchev's Thaw", occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities. The USSR took an early lead in the Space Race with the first ever satellite and the first human spaceflight. In the 1970s, there was a brief d√©tente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the



Question: Argentina invaded UK's Falkland Islands, Israel invaded Southern Lebanon, Canada became officially independent of the UK, Leonid Brezhnev, leader of the USSR, died, all in what year? (Year must be correct)
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the year when all these events happened: Argentina invaded the UK's Falkland Islands, Israel invaded Southern Lebanon, Canada became officially independent of the UK, and Leonid Brezhnev, the leader of the USSR, died. 

First, I'll break down each event and try to remember when they occurred. 

Starting with the Falklands invasion: I remember that the Falklands War was in the early 1980s. Specifically, it was in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands, which are British, so the conflict started in April 1982, and it ended in June 1982 with the British victory.

Next, Israel invading Southern Lebanon. I think this was during the 1980s as well. The invasion was part of the Israeli military operations in Lebanon, which started in 1982. The main invasion was in 1982, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact month. However, the question is about the year, so it's 1982.

Then, Canada becoming officially independent of the UK. Wait, Canada has always been a separate country from the UK, but I think the question is referring to when Canada became a dominion, which was in 1867. However, the context given in the problem is about events that happened after the Soviet Union's dissolution, which was in 1991. So maybe the question is referring to a more recent event. Wait, no, the context provided is about the Soviet Union, but the question is a separate one. So perhaps the user is referring to when Canada became a country on its own, which was in 1867. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and it's about Canada gaining independence, but that's not accurate because Canada has always been independent. Wait, perhaps the user meant when Canada became a member of the United Nations or something else, but that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to when Canada became a dominion, which was in 1867. But I'm not certain. I'll have to check that later.

Lastly, Leonid Brezhnev died. I remember that Brezhnev was a Soviet leader who died in the 1980s. Specifically, I think he died in 1982, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, Brezhnev was the leader from 1964 until his death in 1982. So he died in 1982.

Putting it all together, the events happened in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, Israel invaded Southern Lebanon in 1982, Brezhnev died in 1982, and Canada became a dominion in 1867. Wait, but the question says "Canada became officially independent of the UK." That's confusing because Canada has been independent ['one thousand nine hundred and eighty two', '1982']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Aliens is a 1986 American military science fiction action horror film written and directed by James Cameron, produced by his then-wife Gale Anne Hurd, and starring Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, and Bill Paxton. It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and the second installment in the Alien franchise. The film follows Weaver's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature, thistime accompanied by a unit of space marines.

Aliens was filmed over ten months on a budget of  at Pinewood Studios in England. Cameron, bound by a low budget and a deadline, found it difficult to adjust to what Paxton called the "really indentured" working practices of the British crew, such as the tea breaks that brought production to a halt. The crew were admirers of Ridley Scott, and many of them believed Cameron was too young and inexperienced to direct, despite Cameron's attempts to show them his previous film, The Terminator, which

Aliens received four BAFTA award nominations and won in the category of Visual Effects. It won eight Saturn Awards in the film categories of actress (Sigourney Weaver), supporting actor (Bill Paxton), supporting actress (Jenette Goldstein), performance by a younger actor (Carrie Henn), direction (James Cameron), writing (James Cameron), special effects (Stan Winston and the L.A. Effects Group), and science fiction film.

Aliens was first released on VHS in 1987, finishing as the tenth best-selling title of the year.  A "Special Edition" of Aliens was released in 1992 on laserdisc and VHS that restored seventeen minutes of deleted footage. These additions include a segment showing Newt's family first encountering the derelict spacecraft on LV-426, Ripley learning that her daughter died during the years she was in hypersleep, a scene in the operations building in which the Marines use sentry guns against the

The player has access to iconic weapons from the Aliens movie such as the flamethrower, pulse rifle, smartgun, shotgun, pistol, and robotic sentry turrets and is mainly set in the Aliens world (LV-426). Players are also able to use welding torches to seal doors and motion trackers to detect unseen enemies which also features in the Aliensmovie.Toys

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Hmm, the question is asking about a 2009 family adventure film that stars several actors, including Ashley Tisdale, Carter Jenkins, Robert Hoffman, etc. The question is phrased as "According to [film info], 'The aliens are' where?" So, the question is incomplete, but the key is to find the location where the aliens are in that film.

Wait, but the context given is about the movie "Aliens" (1986), not the 2009 film. So perhaps the question is mixing up different movies.

Wait, the context is about "Aliens" (1986), but the question refers to a 2009 family adventure film. So the context doesn't directly help, but perhaps the answer is inferred from the context.

Wait, the context is about "Aliens" (1986), but the question is about a different movie. So perhaps the answer is that the aliens are on LV-426, as in the movie "Aliens".

Wait, but the question is about a different movie. So maybe the answer is that the aliens are on LV-426, but that's from the 1986 movie. Alternatively, perhaps the 2009 movie is "The Aliens" or something else.

Wait, the question is about a 2009 family adventure film. Let me think: in 2009, there was a movie called "The Aliens" or "Aliens 2"? No, I think "The Aliens" might be a different movie. Alternatively, perhaps it's "Land of the Lost" or something else.

Wait, but the context given is about "Aliens" (1986), so perhaps the answer is that the aliens are on LV-426, but that's from the 1986 movie, not the 2009 one.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. The question is: According to a 2009 adventure family film starring those actors, "The aliens are" where?

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In 1979, the first two stores, built in spaces leased from J. C. Penney that were originally Treasure Island "hypermarket" (discount department and grocery) stores, opened in metro Atlanta (in Doraville and on Memorial Drive in Decatur, both near I-285)  on June 21. Two more opened not long after, and all four shared the space under the "squiggly" zig-zag roof with Zayre on its right side.  The initial public offering occurred in approximately September 1981 and the company became a New York

In terms of overall revenue reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, ahead of rival Lowe's.  The store operates out of large warehouse-style buildings averaging 105,000¬†ft2 (9,755 m2) with megastores operating in larger facilities (the company's largest store, located in Vauxhall, New Jersey is 225,000¬†ft2). 

History

Home Depot stores average 105,000¬†ft2 (9,755 m2) in size and are organized warehouse-style, stocking a large range of supplies.  Home Depot's two largest stores are located in Union, New Jersey, which encompasses 217,000¬†ft2 of space, and in Anaheim Hills, California where it encompasses 204,000¬†ft2.   The company color is a bright orange (PMS 165, CMYK 60M100Y, HEX FF6600), on signs, equipment and employee aprons. It was announced in August 2014 that Craig Menear will take over for Frank Blakeas CEO while Blake will remain the chairman of the board.

The Home Depot (referred to in some countries  and often in colloquial speech simply as Home Depot) is a home improvement supplies superstore that sells tools, construction products and services.

Stock Exchange traded company on April 19, 1984.   The first headquarters was on Terrell Mill Road on the southeast side of Marietta, Georgia, just down from one of the stores at the corner of Cobb Parkway.  (That store , in the Marietta Plaza strip mall, became Value City, changing to Burlington Coat Factory in 2008; part was also a short-lived Little Bucks, in which Brill had a stake.)



Question: "In 1858 Rowland Macy established a new store named ""R. H. Macy & Company"", where it stayed on the same site for nearly forty years, in which city?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "In 1858 Rowland Macy established a new store named 'R. H. Macy & Company', where it stayed on the same site for nearly forty years, in which city?" 

First, I should look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context given is about Home Depot, not Macy's, but maybe there's a clue somewhere. Wait, the context mentions that Home Depot was traded on the stock exchange in 1984, but that's not directly related. It also talks about the first headquarters being in Marietta, Georgia, but that's about Home Depot, not Macy's.

Wait, the question is about R. H. Macy & Company, which is a well-known department store. I don't see any mention of Macy's in the provided context. The context is about Home Depot, so maybe the answer isn't in the context provided. But the user is asking me to answer based on the context given, so perhaps I need to infer or see if any clues are present.

Wait, the context mentions that in 1979, the first two stores opened in metro Atlanta, near I-285, in Doraville and Decatur. It also mentions that the initial public offering was in 1981, and the company became a New York company. But that's about Home Depot.

Wait, the context also mentions that the first headquarters was on Terrell Mill Road in Marietta, Georgia, just down from a store that later became Value City and then Burlington Coat Factory. But that's about Home Depot's history, not Macy's.

Wait, the question is about R. H. Macy & Company established in 1858. I know from general knowledge that R.H. Macy started in New York City, but since the context provided doesn't mention Macy's, perhaps the answer isn't in the context. But the user is asking to answer based on the given context, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the context says that the first headquarters was in Marietta, Georgia, but that's about Home Depot. The question is about R.H. Macy, so perhaps the answer isn't in the context. But the user is instructing to answer based on the provided context, so maybe I'm supposed to find it there.

Wait, perhaps the context is a mix-up, and the question is actually about Home Depot, but the user mistakenly wrote Macy's. Alternatively, maybe the context is about Home Depot, but the question is about Macy's, so the answer isn't provided here.

Wait, the context mentions that the first store opened in 1979 in metro Atlanta, but that's about Home Depot. The question is about 1858, so that's way before Home Depot's time.

Wait, perhaps the context is a distraction, and the answer is New York, as R.H. Macy started in New York.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Figure skating is a sport and activity in which individuals, duos, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport included in the Olympics, in 1908. The four Olympic disciplines are men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating and four skating. From novice through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (short and long) which, depending on the discipline, may include spins,jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.

The International Skating Union (ISU) is the governing body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships and the figure skating events at the Winter Olympic Games. Medals are awarded for overall results. The standard medal colors are gold for first place, silver for second, and bronze for third place. U.S. Figure Skating also awards pewter medals for fourth-place finishers in national events. At the World, European, Four Continents, and World JuniorChampionships, the ISU also awards small medals for segment results (short and free program).

Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the Winter Olympics, the World Championships, the World Junior Championships, the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships, and the Grand Prix series (senior and junior).

The term "professional" in skating refers not to skill level but competitive status. Figure skaters competing at the highest levels of international competition are not "professional" skaters. They are sometimes referred to as amateurs, though some earn money. Professional skaters include those who have lost their ISU eligibility and those who perform only in shows. They may include former Olympic and World champions who have ended their competitive career as well as skaters with little or nointernational competitive experience.

The Ice Skating Institute (ISI), an international ice rink trade organization, runs its own competitive and test program aimed at recreational skaters. Originally headquartered in Minnesota, the organization now operates out of Dallas, Texas. ISI competitions are open to any member that have registered their tests. There are very few "qualifying" competitions, although some districts hold Gold Competitions for that season's first-place winners. ISI competitions are especially popular in Asian

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Rosetta Stone is a rock stele, found in 1799, inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy¬†V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion is Demotic script, and the lowest is Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), the stone provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Study of the decree was already under way when the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the demotic text used

historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study this ancient script, by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time.   The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zo√´ga in the 18th.  The discovery of the Rosetta Stone

and also the postscript in which Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in Greek names and also native Egyptian names. During 1823 he confirmed this, identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in far older hieroglyphic inscriptions that had been copied by Bankes at Abu Simbel and sent on to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. From this point, the stories diverge of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, asChampollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary, both of which were published after his death in 1832.Later work

There had been no understanding of the Ancient Egyptian language and script, before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading hieroglyphs. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by Roman EmperorTheodosius¬†I; the last known inscription is dated to , found at Philae and known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom.



Question: "What year did Jean-Francois Champollion publish the first correct translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs from the Rosetta Stone, the Roman Catholic Church take Galileo Galilei's ""Dialogue"" off their list of banned books, and Britain repeal the death penalty for over 100 crimes?" I'm not sure if all these events happened in the same year, but I need to find out the correct years for each and see if they coincide."

Okay, so I need to figure out the years for three events: when Champollion published the first correct translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs from the Rosetta Stone, when the Roman Catholic Church removed Galileo Galilei's "Dialogue" from their banned list, and when Britain repealed the death penalty for over 100 crimes. I'm not sure if all these happened in the same year, but I need to find each year individually.

First, let's start with Champollion. I remember that the Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799, and Champollion worked on translating it. From the context, it says that the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803, and the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Champollion in Paris in 1822. So, the first correct translation was in 1822.

Next, Galileo Galilei's "Dialogue" was published in 1633. The Catholic Church had it on their banned list, but I think they later removed it. I recall that Galileo's works were rehabilitated after his death. I believe the Church removed "Dialogue" from the banned list in 1835, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, actually, I think it was after his death, and the process of removing it might have happened in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, no, I think the Church had already lifted the ban on "Dialogue" by the time of Galileo's death in 1642, but perhaps it was formally removed later. Alternatively, maybe it was in the 1830s. I'm a bit confused here. I'll need to verify this.

Lastly, Britain repealing the death penalty for over 100 crimes. I know that capital punishment was abolished in the UK in 1965, but I'm not sure if it was for over 100 crimes or just generally. Wait, no, in 1965, the death penalty was abolished for murder, but maybe for other crimes it was abolished earlier. Alternatively, maybe it was in the 19th century. I think it was in the 19th or 20th century. I'm not certain about the exact year.

Wait, I think the UK abolished capital punishment for murder in 1965, but for other crimes, maybe it was earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a specific year when they repealed it for over 100 crimes. I'm not sure, but I think it was in the 19th or 20th century.

So, putting it together:

- Champollion published the translation in 1822.
- The Church removed "Dialogue" from the banned list. I think this happened ['one thousand eight hundred and twenty two', '1822']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: From the Tibetan Plateau the river runs through China's  Yunnan province, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1995, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam established the Mekong River Commission to assist in the management and coordinated use of the Mekong's resources. In 1996 China and Myanmar became "dialogue partners" of the MRC and the six countries now work together within a cooperative framework.

The Mekong is a trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia. It is the world's 12th-longest river  and the 7th-longest in Asia. Its estimated length is 4350 km, and it drains an area of 795000 km2, discharging 457 km3 of water annually.

The Mekong then meets the tripoint of China, Myanmar and Laos.  From there it flows southwest and forms the border of Myanmar and Laos for about 100 km until it arrives at the tripoint of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand.  This is also the point of confluence between the Ruak River (which follows the Thai-Myanmar border) and the Mekong.  The area of this tripoint is sometimes termed the Golden Triangle, although the term also refers to the much larger area of those three countries that is notoriousas a drug producing region.

The Mekong rises as the Za Qu and soon becomes known as the Lancang (Lantsang) in the "Three Rivers Source Area" on the Tibetan Plateau in the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve; the reserve protects the headwaters of, from north to south, the Yellow (Huang He), the Mekong, and the Yangtze Rivers. It flows through the Tibetan Autonomous Region and then southeast into Yunnan Province, and then through the Three Parallel Rivers Area in the Hengduan Mountains, along with the Yangtze to its eastand the Salween River (Nujiang in Chinese) to its west.

The Mekong Basin can be divided into two parts: the 'Upper Mekong Basin' in Tibet of China, and the 'Lower Mekong Basin' from Yunnan downstream from China to the South China Sea. From the point where it rises to its mouth, the most precipitous drop in the Mekong occurs in Upper Mekong Basin, a stretch of some 2200 km. Here, it drops 4500 m before it enters the Lower Basin where the borders of Thailand, Laos, China and Myanmar come together in the Golden Triangle. Downstream from the GoldenTriangle, the river flows for a further 2600 km through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before entering the South China Sea via a complex delta system in Vietnam.



Question: The Mekong River rises in the Tibetan plateau and runs through or between six countries - China, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and which other? The options are: A) India, B) Nepal, C) Bhutan, D) Laos.

Brown allegedly came up with the Famous Flames debut hit, "Please, Please, Please", after Little Richard had written the words on a napkin.  Redding started his professional career with Little Richard's band, The Upsetters. He first entered a talent show performing Little Richard's "Heeby Jeebies", winning for 15 consecutive weeks.

Richard Wayne Penniman (born December 5, 1932), known by his stage name, Little Richard, is an American musician, singer and songwriter.

Little Richard signed with Reprise Records in 1970, releasing the album The Rill Thing, which included the chart-making singles "Freedom Blues" and "Greenwood, Mississippi". His follow-ups for Reprise failed to produce similar success, and He spent much of the decade performing as a guest instrumentalist on sessions with rockers such as Delaney and Bonnie, Joey Covington and Joe Walsh. The sessions for Canned Heat's "Rockin' with the King" (1972) and Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Take It Like a

member.  In December, Jimi and some '50s band members joined Richard in New York for a session of remakes. The most successful collaboration between Little Richard and Hendrix came in the following year, also in New York, when Hendrix, Billy Preston, and Little Richard recorded the soul ballad "I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)", which became a number 12 R&B hit.  Little Richard and Hendrix clashed over tardiness, wardrobe and Hendrix's stage antics, and as a result, in July 1965,

Little Richard was born in Macon, Georgia on December 5, 1932, the third eldest of the 12 children of Leva Mae (n√©e Stewart) and Charles "Bud" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. His mother was a member of Macon's New Hope Baptist Church. Initially, Little Richard's first name was supposed to have been "Ricardo" but an error resulted in "Richard" instead. The Penniman children were raised in a neighborhood of



Question: "After stints backing Little Richard and the Isley Brothers, who was discovered leading ""Jimmy James and the Blue Flames"" at the Caf Wha? in New York and taken to London on 26 September 1966 to make hit records?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out who was discovered leading "Jimmy James and the Blue Flames" at the Caf Wha? in New York and then taken to London to make hit records. The context given is about Little Richard's influence and some collaborations, but I need to focus on the specific question.

First, the question mentions "after stints backing Little Richard and the Isley Brothers." So, the person in question was involved with both Little Richard and the Isley Brothers before this event.

The key part is "leading Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Caf Wha? in New York." So, the person was the leader of that group at that venue.

Then, this person was "taken to London on 26 September 1966 to make hit records." So, someone else took them there, likely a record label or producer.

Looking at the context, I see that Little Richard worked with various artists. There's a mention of a session with Canned Heat and Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Also, in 1965, there was a collaboration with Jimi Hendrix, but that was in New York, not London.

Wait, the context also mentions that in December, Jimi Hendrix and some '50s band members joined Richard in New York for a session. Then, in 1966, they went to London, where they recorded "I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)", which was a hit. So, the collaboration in London involved Little Richard, Jimi Hendrix, and Billy Preston.

But the question is about someone being discovered leading a group at the Caf Wha? and then taken to London. The Isley Brothers are mentioned as someone the person backed. The Isley Brothers were a vocal group, and their members included Ernie Isley, who was a producer and writer. But the question is about someone leading a group, not necessarily the Isley Brothers.

Wait, the Isley Brothers were a group, but the question says "after stints backing Little Richard and the Isley Brothers," so the person was backing both. Then, the person led Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Caf Wha? in New York. The Caf Wha? was a famous venue in New York, known for discovering talent.

After that, the person was taken to London on September 26, 1966, to make hit records. So, who was that?

Looking at the context, the person who was taken to London with Hendrix and Preston was Little Richard. But the question is about someone else, because it's after stints backing Little Richard and the Isley Brothers. So, the person in question was not Little Richard but someone else who was backing both.

Wait, the context says that after Little Richard's session with Hendrix, he was involved in other collaborations. But the question is about someone else who was backing both Little Richard and the Is ['johnny allen hendrix', 'jimmy hendrix', 'jim hendrix', 'jimi hendrix', 'jimy hendrix', 'hendrix', 'jimmy hendricks', 'early life of jimi hendrix', 'electric church', 'gypsy suns and rainbows', 'heaven research', 'villanova junction', 'james hendrix', 'al hendrix', 'james marshall hendrix', 'gypsy sun and rainbows', 'lithofayne pridgeon', 'janie hendrix', 'jimmi hendrix']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up.  In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes  and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in

Stand-up comedy is the focus of four major international festivals: the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland; Just for Laughs in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; HBO's U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, CO, and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in Melbourne, Australia. A number of other festivals operate around the world, including The Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, the Vancouver Comedy Festival, the New York Comedy Festival, the Boston Comedy and Film Festival, the New York

observational humor being the prominent styles to flourish. In 1983, young drama teacher Maria Kempinska created Jongleurs Comedy Clubs, now the largest stand-up comedy chain in Europe. Stand up comedy is believed to have been performed originally as a one-man show. Lately, this type of show started to involve a group of young comedians, especially in Europe.United States

Underground Film Festival, the Sydney Comedy Festival, and the Cat Laughs Comedy Festival in Kilkenny, Ireland. Radio hosts Opie and Anthony also produce a comedy tour called Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, featuring their own co-host, Jim Norton as well as several other stand-up comedians regularly featured on their radio show. There is also a festival in Hong Kong called the HK International Comedy Festival.

North American stand-up comedy has its roots in various traditions of popular entertainment of the late 19th century, including vaudeville, English music hall, burlesque or early variety shows; minstrel shows, humorist monologues by personalities such as Mark Twain, and circus clown antics. With the turn of the century and ubiquitousness of urban and industrial living, the structure, pacing and timing, and material of American humor began to change. Comedians of this era often depended on



Question: "In Australia, what is known as a ""Laughing Jackass""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out what a "Laughing Jackass" is known as in Australia. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The context talks about stand-up comedy and various festivals around the world, including the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in Melbourne, Australia. It also mentions that in Europe, Jongleurs Comedy Clubs were created by Maria Kempinska in 1983 and are now the largest stand-up comedy chain in Europe. 

Wait, the question is specifically about Australia. So I'm looking for something related to stand-up comedy in Australia. The context mentions the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, but that's not directly the term "Laughing Jackass." 

Hmm, maybe "Laughing Jackass" is a term used in stand-up comedy in Australia. Let me think about Australian slang or terms related to comedy. I recall that in some countries, they have specific terms for types of comedy or performers. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in North America, stand-up comedy has roots in vaudeville and other traditional entertainments. But that's not directly helpful. 

Wait, the context says that in Europe, Jongleurs Comedy Clubs are the largest chain. So maybe in Australia, there's a similar term. Alternatively, perhaps "Laughing Jackass" is a term used for a specific type of comedy show or style. 

Wait, the context doesn't explicitly mention "Laughing Jackass," but it does talk about various festivals and the evolution of stand-up comedy. Maybe "Laughing Jackass" is a term used in Australia for a particular kind of stand-up performance or group. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reference to a specific comedy group or style. I'm not entirely sure, but given the context, the closest I can get is that in Australia, a "Laughing Jackass" might refer to a stand-up comedy group or a specific type of performance. 

Wait, the context mentions that in Europe, Jongleurs Comedy Clubs are the largest chain. So maybe in Australia, there's a similar group. But the question is about the term "Laughing Jackass." 

Alternatively, maybe "Laughing Jackass" is a term used in Australia for a particular style of stand-up comedy, perhaps observational or something else. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in North America, stand-up comedy has roots in various traditions, including vaudeville and minstrel shows. But again, that's not directly helpful for the term "Laughing Jackass." 

I think I might have to make an educated guess here. Since the context mentions various comedy festivals and clubs, perhaps "Laughing Jackass" is a term used in Australia for a specific type of stand-up comedy group or style. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in slang, "jackass" can mean a fool or someone acting foolishly. So "Laughing Jackass" might be a term for a comedic act ['kookaburras', 'dacelo novaeguinea', 'kookabura', 'dacelo', 'kookaburra']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively chunky body, dense coat and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", a solid blue-gray with copper eyes, but the breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colorpoint.

all cats with the "blue" colouration were then judged together as variants on a de facto single breed, the Blue Shorthair, outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common.

* Ruby in the film adaptation of the memoir Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen is a British Blue.
* The Internet meme grafics cat [sic] is a golden-shaded British Shorthair. The original picture is of a cat named Helia Peppercats, and came from a Russian cat breeder's website.
* Puss in Boots from the Shrek franchise is described as and closely resembles a British Shorthair, although he speaks with a strong Spanish accent. The character is modelled on famous Norfolk cat, Bon Bon.

* Smokey the cat in E.B. White's children's novel Stuart Little was a British Blue.
* A silver tabby British Shorthair is the mascot of Whiskas brand cat food.
* Winston Churchill (Church) from Pet Sematary is a British Blue.
* Toby, of the ABC prime time drama Desperate Housewives, is a British Shorthair.
* Arlene, Garfield the cat's girlfriend, is portrayed as a British Blue in Garfield: The Movie
* Mick, from Kamen Rider W, is a British Shorthair who can turn into the Smilodon Dopant.

Selective breeding of the best examples of the type began in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-grey variant called the "British Blue" or "English type" (to distinguish it from the more fine-boned "Russian type") in particular. Some sources directly credit UK artist and pioneering cat fancier Harrison Weir with the initial concept of standardizing the breed; others suggest a group of breeders may have been involved. The new British Shorthair was featured at thefirst-ever cat show, organised by Weir and held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871, and enjoyed great initial popularity.



Question: What colour cat is a Russian Blue? The context says that the British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively chunky body, dense coat and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", a solid blue-gray with copper eyes, but the breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colorpoint.

The context also says that outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common. So, the Russian Blue is a separate type, and the British Shorthair is a different breed. So, the Russian Blue is a different color. The question is, what color is a Russian Blue?

Looking at the context, the Russian Blue is described as the more fine-boned "Russian type" compared to the British Shorthair. The British Shorthair has a "British Blue" which is solid blue-gray with copper eyes. So, the Russian Blue is a different color. The context doesn't explicitly state the color of the Russian Blue, but it's implied that the British Blue is blue-gray, and the Russian Blue is a different type, perhaps with a different coloration.

Wait, but the context says that the British Shorthair has been developed in a wide range of other colors and patterns, including tabby and colorpoint. So, the Russian Blue is a separate type, but the context doesn't specify its color. However, the question is about the Russian Blue's color. Since the British Blue is blue-gray, perhaps the Russian Blue is a different color, like black or another shade.

But the context doesn't explicitly say. Wait, the context says that the Russian Blue is a separate type, more fine-boned, and that the British Shorthair was developed from it. So, the Russian Blue is the parent type, and the British Shorthair is the offspring. So, the Russian Blue is a different color, but the context doesn't specify. However, the question is asking what color the Russian Blue is.

Wait, the context says that the British Shorthair was developed in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-gray variant called the "British Blue". So, the Russian Blue is a separate type, perhaps with a different coloration. But the context doesn't specify the color of the Russian Blue. So, perhaps the answer is that the Russian Blue is a different color, but the context doesn't specify.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Europe. Of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami (which was caused by the Azores‚ÄìGibraltar Transform Fault), the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes, each causing several ten thousand deaths and the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in

History

While Japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis, the sheer destruction caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times, killing around 230,000 people.  The Sumatran region is not unused to tsunamis either, with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island.

modern Europe. The Storegga Slide in the Norwegian sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the British Isles refer to landslide and meteotsunamis predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves.

in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.   It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' reaction was to move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.

Examples of tsunami originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include Storegga about 8,000 years ago, Grand Banks 1929, Papua New Guinea 1998 (Tappin, 2001). The Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments, causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami. They dissipated before traveling transoceanic distances.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Petronas Towers, also known as the Petronas Twin Towers (Malay: Menara Petronas, or Menara Berkembar Petronas), are twin skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH)'s official definition and ranking, they were the tallest buildings in the world from 1998 to 2004 and remain the tallest twin towers in the world. The buildings are a landmark of Kuala Lumpur, along with nearby Kuala Lumpur Tower.

History

As a result of the Malaysian government specifying that the buildings be completed in six years, two construction consortiums were hired to meet the deadline, one for each tower. Tower 1, the west tower (right in the top-right photograph) was built by a Japanese consortium led by the Hazama Corporation (JA Jones Construction Co., MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd, Ho Hup Construction Co. Bhd and Mitsubishi Corp) while Tower 2, the east tower (left in the top-right photograph) was built by aSouth Korean consortium led by the Samsung C&T Corporation (Kukdong Engineering & Construction and Syarikat Jasatera Sdn Bhd).

The Petronas Towers were the tallest buildings in the world for six years, until Taipei 101 was completed in 2004. The height of the towers is measured to the top of their structural components such as spires, but do not include antennas.  Spires are considered actual integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, to which changes would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The PetronasTowers still remain the tallest twin buildings in the world.

that accommodates its slender profile and provides 560,000 square metres of column-free office space.  Below the twin towers is Suria KLCC, a shopping mall, and Dewan Filharmonik Petronas, the home of the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.Notable events*On 15 April 1999, Felix Baumgartner set the world record for BASE jumping (since broken) by jumping off a window cleaning crane on the Petronas Towers.

On the top of each tower is a pinnacle standing  tall. The pinnacles were more than just the finishing touches to the height of the towers, each taking over 19 weeks to construct and both being assembled outside the country.  One was constructed in Japan and the other in Korea. Each pinnacle is composed of 50 unique parts making up the main components: the spire, mast ball and ring ball. Together these parts weigh 176 tons. While the pinnacles may seem to be an aesthetic feature of the towers



Question: "What country's ""Kingdom Tower"" is planned to be more than a kilometer tall when it is completed in 2018?" 

Wait, the question is about a "Kingdom Tower" planned to be more than a kilometer tall, completed in 2018. But in the context provided, the Petronas Towers are mentioned, but the question is about a different tower.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, doing business as Amtrak, is a passenger railroad service that provides medium- and long-distance intercity service in the contiguous United States. Founded in 1971 to take over most of the remaining U.S. passenger rail services, it is partially government-funded yet operated and managed as a for-profit corporation.

The name "Amtrak" is a portmanteau of the words "America" and "trak", the latter itself a sensational spelling of "track".  

History

Pre-Amtrak

Privately operated passenger rail service

From the mid-19th century until about 1920, nearly all intercity travelers in the United States moved by rail.  Historically, U.S. passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains. About 65,000 railroad passenger cars operated in 1929.

silver Pioneer Zephyr and Flying Yankee. Even with the improvements, on a relative basis, traffic continued to decline, and by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of passenger-miles in the United States.

Amtrak began operations on May 1, 1971. Amtrak received no rail tracks or right-of-way at its inception. All Amtrak's routes were continuations of prior service, although Amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network. Of the 364 trains operated previously, Amtrak only continued 182. On trains that continued, to the extent possible, schedules were retained with only minor changes from the Official Guide of the Railways, and under the same names. Several major corridors became freight-only,

In addition to these lines Amtrak owns station and yard tracks in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland (Kirkham Street Yard), Orlando, Portland, Oregon, Saint Paul, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Amtrak leases station and yard tracks in Hialeah, near Miami, Florida, from the State of Florida.



Question: "On what ""railroad"" was Harriet Tubman a conductor?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out on which railroad Harriet Tubman was a conductor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Harriet Tubman. She was an African-American abolitionist who helped people escape slavery using the Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses that helped enslaved people escape to freedom in the Northern United States.

Wait, but the question is about a specific railroad, not the Underground Railroad. So maybe the question is referring to a real railroad, not the network of secret routes. I should check the context provided.

Looking at the context, it's about Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. The context mentions that Amtrak was founded in 1971 to take over most of the remaining U.S. passenger rail services. It also talks about the history before Amtrak, mentioning privately operated passenger rail service from the mid-19th century until about 1920. So, the context is about Amtrak's history and operations.

But the question is about Harriet Tubman being a conductor on a railroad. Since the context provided doesn't mention Harriet Tubman, I might need to think about what I know outside of this context. Harriet Tubman worked with the Underground Railroad, which was a network, not a railroad company. However, the Underground Railroad used real railroads, like the Pennsylvania Railroad or the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, to help people escape.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking on which railroad she was a conductor. So, perhaps the answer is one of the actual railroads that were part of the Underground Railroad network. But the context given is about Amtrak, so maybe the answer is Amtrak, but that doesn't make sense because the Underground Railroad was before Amtrak existed.

Alternatively, perhaps the context is trying to link Amtrak to the Underground Railroad, but that's not directly stated. The context mentions that Amtrak took over passenger rail services, but it doesn't mention Harriet Tubman.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Amtrak, but that doesn't fit because she wasn't on Amtrak. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that she wasn't on a railroad in the context provided, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the context is trying to set up that Amtrak is the modern version, and the Underground Railroad was the old version. But the question is specifically about which railroad she was a conductor on. So, perhaps the answer is that she was a conductor on the Underground Railroad, but that's not one of the railroads mentioned in the context.

Wait, the context says that Amtrak owns or leases tracks in several cities, but it doesn't mention the Underground Railroad. So, perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't mention her, but I have to answer based on what I know.

Wait, the question is within the context provided, so I have to answer based on that. Since the ['underground railroad system', 'conductor underground railroad', 'ugrr', 'national underground railroad network to freedom', 'underground railway', 'underground railroad']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: On August 29, at 7:40 am CDT, it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the Hyatt Regency New Orleans had been blown out, and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage.  The Hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city, with beds reported to be flying out of the windows. Insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off.

According to the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, in St. Bernard Parish, 81% (20,229) of the housing units were damaged. In St. Tammany Parish, 70% (48,792) were damaged and in Placquemines Parish 80% (7,212) were damaged. 

In addition, the combined effect of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was the destruction of an estimated 562 km2 of coastal wetlands in Louisiana. 

New Orleans

On August 29, Katrina's storm surge caused 53 different breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater New Orleans area, submerging eighty percent of the city. A June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding were caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls.  The storm surge also devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, making Katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the

FEMA provided housing assistance (rental assistance, trailers, etc.) to more than 700,000 applicants‚Äîfamilies and individuals. However, only one-fifth of the trailers requested in Orleans Parish were supplied, resulting in an enormous housing shortage in the city of New Orleans.  Many local areas voted to not allow the trailers, and many areas had no utilities, a requirement prior to placing the trailers. To provide for additional housing, FEMA has also paid for the hotel costs of 12,000

Katrina caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the storm surge and levee failure. Severe property damage occurred in coastal areas, such as Mississippi beachfront towns; over 90 percent of these were flooded. Boats and casino barges rammed buildings, pushing cars and houses inland; water reached 6 - from the beach.

This era followed after the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word "baroque" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning misshapen pearl. The use of the word with negative connotations was first used in 1734, in a criticism of an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, and later (1750) in a description by Charles de Brosses of the ornate and heavily ornamented architecture

Late baroque music (1680‚Äì1730)

The work of George Frederic Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach and their contemporaries, including Domenico Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Georg Philipp Telemann, and others advanced the Baroque era to its climax. Through the work of Johann Fux, the Renaissance style of polyphony was made the basis for the study of composition.

As late as 1960 there was still considerable dispute in academic circles, particularly in France and Britain, whether it was meaningful to lump together music as diverse as that of Jacopo Peri, Domenico Scarlatti, and J.S. Bach under a single rubric. Nevertheless, the term has become widely used and accepted for this broad range of music. It may be helpful to distinguish the Baroque from both the preceding (Renaissance) and following (Classical) periods of musical history.

History

Baroque music forms a major portion of the "classical music" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Marin Marais, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, Fran√ßois Couperin, Denis Gaultier, Claudio Monteverdi, Michael Praetorius, Heinrich Sch√ºtz,Girolamo Frescobaldi, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jan Dismas Zelenka, and Johann Pachelbel.

instrumental music, and discussed such ancient Greek music devices as monody, which consisted of a solo singing accompanied by a kithara (an ancient strummed string instrument). The early realizations of these ideas, including Jacopo Peri's Dafne and L'Euridice, marked the beginning of opera, which were a catalyst for Baroque music.



Question: "Sting's 2006 album ""Into the Labyrinth"" is a collection of songs by John Dowland who was a 16th-17th century virtuoso on what instrument?" 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the question is about Sting's album, but the context given is about Baroque music, which is from 1600-1750. So, the question is mixing up two different contexts. But the question is about a 2006 album by Sting, which is modern, not Baroque. So, the context given is about Baroque, but the question is about a modern artist. So, the answer would be unrelated to the context. But the user is asking me to answer based on the context provided, which is about Baroque. So, perhaps the question is a trick, but the correct answer is that the context doesn't mention Sting or his album, so the answer is not provided in the context.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Over time, various Wild West shows were developed. They were started by people with generally flamboyant names such as Dr. W.F. Carver, Pawnee Bill, "Buckskin Joe" Hoyt,  and Mexican Joe.  Blacks (such as Bill Pickett - the famous bulldogger from the 101 Ranch Wild West Show - his brothers, and Voter Hall - billed as a "Feejee Indian from Africa" ), Mexicans (such as the Esquivel Brothers from San Antonio), Native Americans (including the illustrious war leader Red Cloud), and women also tried

The list of famous Wild West show participants was not limited to men.  Women were also a large part of Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West show and attracted many spectators.  In fact Annie Oakley, one of the show‚Äôs star attractions was a woman.  Born Phoebe Ann Moses, Oakley first gained recognition as a sharpshooter when she defeated Frank Butler, a pro marksman at age 15, in a shooting exhibition.  She became the star attraction of Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West show for 16 years, under the management of

really a ‚Äúpuffed-up exaggeration‚Äù  of the real western frontier. The shaping of this myth of western life was aided into creation by films, dime novels, live performances, paintings, pulp magazines, sculptures, and television.  More than anyone or anything else, William Frederick Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, can be credited with helping to create and preserve a lasting legend of the West. Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West show took the reality of western life and glamorized it into an appealingshow for Eastern audiences and helped to permanently preserve the legend of the Wild West.The "Real" Wild West

The mythology and legends of the American West evoke images of adventure filled with cowboys, Indians, wild animals, wild parties with outlaws, and stagecoaches. The real American West of the 19th century was not nearly as glamorous as often depicted. Cowboys, Native American Indians, army scouts, outlaws, and wild animals did truly exist in the West. However, gunfights, stagecoach attacks, and train holdups were not an everyday ordeal.  The dramatic myth of the Wild West as we see it today is

His track of fame began as with his reputation as a master buffalo hunter.  While hunting buffalo for pay to feed railroad workers, he shot and killed 11 out of 12 buffalo, earning him his nickname and show name ‚ÄúBuffalo Bill.‚Äù  As an army scout, Cody extended his fame by gaining recognition as an army scout with a reputation for bravery. As a well-known scout, he often led rich men from the East and Europe and even royalty on hunting trips.  Cody‚Äôs fame began to spread to the East when an



Question: "Who in the wild west was known as ""Iron Eyes"" among his other nicknames?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out who "Iron Eyes" was a nickname for in the context given. Let me read through the context again to find clues.

The context talks about various Wild West show participants with flamboyant names like Dr. W.F. Carver, Pawnee Bill, "Buckskin Joe" Hoyt, and Mexican Joe. It also mentions that women like Annie Oakley were part of the shows. Then it goes into how the myth of the Wild West was created, mentioning Buffalo Bill Cody as a key figure.

Further down, it says that Cody's fame began as a master buffalo hunter, where he earned the nickname "Buffalo Bill." It also mentions that he was known as an army scout with a reputation for bravery, leading rich men and even royalty on hunting trips. His fame spread to the East when an article about him was published.

Wait, the question is about "Iron Eyes." I don't recall that name appearing in the context. The names mentioned are Dr. W.F. Carver, Pawnee Bill, Buckskin Joe, Mexican Joe, Bill Pickett, Voter Hall, Esquivel Brothers, Red Cloud, Annie Oakley, and Buffalo Bill Cody.

Hmm, maybe "Iron Eyes" is a nickname for someone else not directly mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reference to someone else. Wait, the context mentions that the Wild West shows were "started by people with generally flamboyant names," but the question is about a specific nickname, "Iron Eyes."

Wait, perhaps "Iron Eyes" refers to someone else, maybe a participant not listed by name. Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to a character from the shows. But in the context, the only notable female participant is Annie Oakley, and the others are male.

Wait, the context also mentions that the Wild West shows were "started by people with generally flamboyant names," but the question is about a specific nickname, "Iron Eyes." I don't see that name in the context. Maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is that "Iron Eyes" isn't mentioned, but that can't be because the question expects an answer.

Wait, perhaps "Iron Eyes" is a nickname for someone else, like Bill Pickett, who is mentioned as a "bulldogger" from the 101 Ranch Wild West Show. But the context doesn't mention "Iron Eyes" for him.

Alternatively, maybe "Iron Eyes" refers to someone else, like Voter Hall, who is described as a "Feejee Indian from Africa." But that's a different nickname.

Wait, perhaps "Iron Eyes" is a nickname for someone else, like Annie Oakley? But she's known as Annie Oakley, not Iron Eyes.

Wait, the context says that the Wild West shows were "started by people with generally flamboyant names," but the question is about "Iron Eyes." Maybe "Iron Eyes" ['william frederick 22buffalo bill 22 cody', 'buffalo bill', 'buffalo bill s wild west', 'buffalo bill s wild west show', 'bill cody', 'william f cody', 'wild west rocky mountain and prairie exhibition', 'buffalo bill cody s wild west show', 'william fRank buffalo bill cody', 'william frederick cody', 'buffalo bill cody', 'william cody']

The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA,; ;  ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The word "automobile" is a classical compound derived from the Ancient Greek word aut√≥s (Œ±·ΩêœÑœåœÇ), meaning "self", and the Latin word mobilis, meaning "movable". It entered the English language from French, and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.  Over time, the word "automobile" fell out of favour in Britain, and was replaced by "motor car". It remains a chiefly North American usage.  An abbreviated form, "auto", was formerly a common way to refer to cars inEnglish, but is now considered old-fashioned. The word is still used in some compound formations in American English, like "auto industry" and "auto mechanic".

[http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/special_collections/local/cfai/index.php 'Car' derived from 'carrus'] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.   "Motor car" is attested from 1895, and is the usual formal name for cars in British English.  "Autocar" is a variant that is also attested from 1895, but that is now considered archaic. It literally means "self-propelled car".  The term "horseless carriage" was used by some to refer to the firstcars at the time that they were being built, and is attested from 1895.

A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.  The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz

In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz

The word "car" is believed to originate from the Latin word carrus or carrum ("wheeled vehicle"), or the Middle English word carre (meaning cart, from Old North French). In turn, these originated from the Gaulish word karros (a Gallic chariot). The Gaulish language was a branch of the Brythoic language which also used the word Karr; the Brythonig language evolved into Welsh (and Gaelic) where 'Car llusg' (a drag cart or sledge) and 'car rhyfel' (war chariot) still survive.



Question: When suffix letters were first used on British car registration plates the letter was used for a calendar year, later, to suit the car industry, the letter changed on August 1 each year, which letter was consequently used for only seven months? 

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand all the details.

The context talks about the word "car" and its origins, different terms for cars, like "motor car" and "auto," and some historical information about the invention of cars by Karl Benz. It also mentions the term "horseless carriage" and some details about car definitions and the birth of the modern car in 1886.

Wait, the question is about British car registration plates. It mentions that when suffix letters were first used, they were used for a calendar year. Then, later, the letter changed on August 1 each year. Because of this change, a letter was consequently used for only seven months. The question is asking which letter was used for only seven months.

Hmm, so I need to figure out which letter was used for seven months because of the change in the suffix letter on August 1.

Let me think about how car registration plates work. In many countries, including the UK, the suffix on a car's registration plate often represents the year the car was registered. Traditionally, this was a two-digit year, but in the UK, they switched to a three-digit format, I believe, but the context here is about when they changed the suffix letter.

Wait, the context says that the suffix letters were first used for a calendar year, but later, they changed on August 1 each year. So, the suffix letter was used for a full year at first, but then it was changed in August, meaning that for the first eight months of the year, the old suffix was used, and then starting in August, the new suffix was used.

Wait, no. Let me parse that again. The suffix letters were first used for a calendar year, meaning that each year, the suffix would be the same for the entire year. Then, later, they changed the suffix on August 1 each year. So, the suffix would change in August, meaning that for the first seven months of the year (January to July), the old suffix was used, and from August onwards, the new suffix was used.

Wait, but the question is about which letter was consequently used for only seven months. So, the suffix letters were changed in August, so the previous year's suffix was used for the first seven months, and then the new suffix was used for the remaining months.

Wait, but the question is about the letter that was used for only seven months. So, the suffix letters were changed on August 1, so the previous suffix was used from January to July (7 months), and the new suffix was used from August to December (6 months). So, the previous suffix was used for seven months, and the new suffix was used for six months.

Wait, but the question is about which letter was used for only seven months. So, the letter that was used as ['üÑ¥', 'üÖ¥', 'üÖî', '‚í†', 'ÔΩÖ', 'e', 'e letter', 'üÑî']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Dirty Harry is a 1971 American action thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, the first in the Dirty Harry series. Clint Eastwood plays the title role, in his first outing as San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan. The film drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer as the Callahan character seeks out a similar vicious psychopath.

A psychopathic serial killer calling himself "Scorpio" (Andy Robinson) shoots a young woman in a San Francisco swimming pool from a nearby rooftop. SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail message demanding the city pay him $100,000 whilst also promising that for each day his demand is refused he will commit a murder; his next victim will be "a Catholic priest or a nigger." The chief of police and the mayor (John Vernon) assign the inspector to the case, despite hisreputation for violent solutions.

Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do.

In 2010, artist James Georgopoulos included the screen-used guns from Dirty Harry in his popular Guns of Cinema series. 

The 2013 satirical comedy film InAPPropriate Comedy parodied the character Dirty Harry with a fake trailer called "Flirty Harry", in which Flirty Harry was played by Adrien Brody.

The 2014 video game Sunset Overdrive features a gun with the same name.

Dirty Harry was a critical and commercial success and set the style for a whole genre of police films. It was followed by four sequels: Magnum Force in 1973, The Enforcer in 1976, Sudden Impact in 1983 (directed by Eastwood himself) and The Dead Pool in 1988.

In 2012 the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant." 

Plot



Question: "In the film of the same name, what was the name of ""The Hustler""?" 

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again. The question is: "In the film of the same name, what was the name of ""The Hustler""?" 

Wait, the context is about the movie "Dirty Harry". So the question is referring to "The Hustler" in the context of "Dirty Harry". But in the context provided, the only mention of "The Hustler" is in the context of the film's plot. 

Wait, the context says: "Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do."

Wait, that's the only mention of "The Hustler" in the context. So perhaps the question is referring to a character or a term from the movie. But in the context, "The Hustler" isn't explicitly mentioned. 

Wait, perhaps the question is a typo or misstatement. Maybe it's referring to "The Hustler" as a term used in the movie. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a character named "The Hustler" in the movie, but in the context provided, the only relevant term is "Scorpio" as the killer's name.

Wait, perhaps the question is about "The Hustler" being a nickname for Harry Callahan. In the context, it says that Harry Callahan is given every dirty job, and his nickname comes from that. So perhaps "The Hustler" is another term for Harry Callahan.

Wait, but in the context, the term used is "Dirty Harry". So maybe "The Hustler" is not explicitly mentioned, but perhaps the question is referring to "Dirty Harry" as the name of the film, and "The Hustler" is a term used in the film.

Wait, the question is: "In the film of the same name, what was the name of ""The Hustler""?" 

Wait, the film is "Dirty Harry". So the question is asking, in "Dirty Harry", what was the name of "The Hustler"? But in the context provided, "The Hustler" isn't explicitly mentioned. The context talks about Scorpio, the killer, and Harry Callahan's nickname being "Dirty Harry".

Wait, perhaps "The Hustler" is a term used for Harry Callahan. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misstatement, and the question is about "Dirty Harry" being the name of the film, and "The Hustler" is a term used in the film.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to "The Hustler" as a character, but ['fast eddie felson']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Henry IV (15 April 1367 ‚Äì 20 March 1413) was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1399 to 1413 and asserted the claim of his grandfather, Edward III, to the Kingdom of France. He was born at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, hence his other name, Henry of Bolingbroke.

Arundel as his advisor, Henry began a military campaign, confiscating land from those who opposed him and ordering his soldiers to destroy much of Cheshire. Henry quickly gained enough power and support to have himself declared King Henry IV, imprison King Richard (who died in prison under mysterious circumstances) and bypass Richard's 7-year-old heir-presumptive, Edmund de Mortimer. Henry's coronation, on 13 October 1399, may have marked the first time following the Norman Conquest when themonarch made an address in English.

One of Henry's elder sisters, Philippa of Lancaster, married John I of Portugal, and the other, Elizabeth, was the mother of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. His younger half-sister Catherine, the daughter of his father's second wife, Constance of Castile, was queen consort of Castile. He also had four half-siblings by Katherine Swynford, originally his sisters' governess, then his father's longstanding mistress, and later his third wife. These four children were given the surname Beaufortafter a castle their father held in Champagne, France.

contrast, Richard II had no children and Richard's heir-presumptive Edmund Mortimer was only seven years old. The only two of Henry's six children who produced children to survive to adulthood were Henry V and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Henry IV's male Lancaster line ended in 1471 during the War of the Roses, between the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, with the deaths of his grandson Henry VI and Henry VI's son Edward, Prince of Wales. The descendants of Henry IV's son Humphrey, Duke of

Mary died in 1394, and on 7 February 1403 Henry married Joanna of Navarre, the daughter of Charles d'√âvreux, King of Navarre, at Winchester. She was the widow of John IV, Duke of Brittany (known in traditional English sources as John V),  with whom she had had four daughters and four sons; however, her marriage to the King of England was to be childless.  But Henry had already four sons from his first marriage, which was undoubtedly a clinching factor in his acceptability for the throne. By



Question: What was the name of the older brother of Henry 8th? Wait, no, the question is about Henry IV's older brother. Wait, no, the question is about Henry IV's older brother. Wait, no, the question is about Henry IV's older brother. Wait, no, the context is about Henry IV, so the question is about his older brother. Wait, the question is: What was the name of Henry IV's older brother?

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: What was the name of Henry IV's older brother? Let me read through the context provided.

The context starts by saying Henry IV was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1399 to 1413. It mentions that he was born at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, hence his other name, Henry of Bolingbroke. 

Then it talks about his advisor, Arundel, and his military campaign. It also mentions that Henry IV imprisoned King Richard, who died under mysterious circumstances, and bypassed Richard's heir-presumptive, Edmund de Mortimer, who was seven years old. 

Next, it discusses Henry's coronation and his use of English in his address. Then it goes into his siblings: one sister, Philippa of Lancaster, married John I of Portugal, and another sister, Elizabeth, was the mother of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. His younger half-sister Catherine was queen consort of Castile. He also had four half-siblings by Katherine Swynford, who became his third wife. These four children were given the surname Beaufort after a castle in Champagne, France.

Wait, so Henry IV's siblings are mentioned here. His older sister is Philippa of Lancaster. But the question is about his older brother, not sister. So I need to check if there's a mention of his older brother.

Looking through the context again, it doesn't explicitly mention his older brother. It talks about his sisters but not his brothers. Wait, but the context does mention that Henry IV's father was Edward III, who had several children. Edward III's children included Philippa of Lancaster, Elizabeth, and Catherine. But the context doesn't mention any older brother of Henry IV.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read carefully. The context says Henry IV was the son of Edward III, and Edward III had children like Philippa, Elizabeth, and Catherine. But it doesn't mention any older brother of Henry IV. So maybe Henry IV didn't have an older brother, or the context doesn't mention him.

Wait, but the question is about Henry IV's older brother. If the context doesn't mention any, perhaps the answer is that he didn't have an older brother, or maybe the context refers to someone else.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the context again. The context starts by saying Henry IV was the King, born at Bolingbroke, and then talks about his sisters ['arthur', 'arthur name']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Beatles were  an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their

The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after

On 25 June 1967, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single, "All You Need Is Love", to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his

their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname "the Fab Four" as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) andAbbey Road (1969).

During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five. Their popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and a number of other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Puffing Billy is an early railway steam locomotive, constructed in 1813‚Äì14 by engineer William Hedley, enginewright Jonathan Forster and blacksmith Timothy Hackworth for Christopher Blackett, the owner of Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne, in the United Kingdom.  It is the world's oldest surviving steam locomotive.   It was the first commercial adhesion steam locomotive, employed to haul coal chaldron wagons from the mine at Wylam to the docks at Lemington-on-Tyne in Northumberland.

Puffing Billy remained in service until 1862, Edward Blackett, the owner of Wylam Colliery, lent it to the Patent Office Museum in South Kensington, London (later the Science Museum). He later sold it to the museum for ¬£200. It is still on display there. Its sister locomotive, Wylam Dilly, is preserved in the Royal Museum in Edinburgh.

History 

Puffing Billy was one of the three similar engines built by Hedley, the resident engineer at Wylam Colliery, to replace the horses used as motive power on the tramway. In 1813 Hedley built for Blackett's colliery business on the Wylam Colliery line the prototypes, "Puffing Billy" and "Wylam Dilly". They were both rebuilt in 1815 with ten wheels, but were returned to their original condition in 1830 when the railway was relaid with stronger rails.

In the September 1814 edition of Annals of Philosophy two locomotives with rack wheels are mentioned (probably Salamanca and Bl√ºcher), then there is mention of "another steam locomotive at Newcastle, employed for a similar purpose [hauling coals], and moving along without any rack wheel, simply by its friction against the rail road".  From the context this is at a different location to Bl√ºcher, so is probably Puffing Billy.

Puffing Billy incorporated a number of novel features, patented by Hedley, which were to prove important to the development of locomotives. It had two vertical cylinders on either side of the boiler, and partly enclosed by it, and drove a single crankshaft beneath the frames, from which gears drove and also coupled the wheels allowing better traction.



Question: In Chigley on Children's TV who owned the steam railway and drove the steam engine 'Bessie'? 

Wait, the question is about a children's TV show. I think it's from "Thomas the Tank Engine" or similar. But the context given is about Puffing Billy, which is a real historical locomotive. So perhaps the question is mixing up real and fictional elements.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Uruk (Cuneiform: ,URU UNUG; , '; Sumerian: Unug; Akkadian: Uruk; Aramaic/Hebrew:  '; ,  ') was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia, situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates river, on the dried-up, ancient channel of the Euphrates River, some 30¬†km east of modern As-Samawah, Al-MuthannƒÅ, Iraq.Uruk is the type site for the Uruk period. Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid 4th millennium BC.

Geographic factors underpin Uruk's unprecedented growth. The city was located in the southern part of Mesopotamia, an ancient site of civilization, on the Euphrates river. Through the gradual and eventual domestication of native grains from the Zagros foothills  and extensive irrigation techniques, the area supported a vast variety of edible vegetation. This domestication of grain and its proximity to rivers enabled Uruk's growth into the largest Sumerian settlement, in both population andarea, with relative ease.

At its height c. 2900¬†BC, Uruk probably had 50,000‚Äì80,000 residents living in 6¬†km2 of walled area; making it the largest city in the world at the time. The legendary king Gilgamesh, according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian king list, ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC. The city lost its prime importance around 2000¬†BC, in the context of the struggle of Babylonia with Elam, but it remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid and Parthian periods until it was finally abandoned shortlybefore or after the Islamic conquest.

In addition to being one of the first cities, Uruk was the main force of urbanization and state formation during the Uruk period, or 'Uruk expansion' (4000‚Äì3200 BC). This period of 800¬†years saw a shift from small, agricultural villages to a larger urban center with a full-time bureaucracy, military, and stratified society. Although other settlements coexisted with Uruk, they were generally about 10 hectares while Uruk was significantly larger and more complex. The Uruk period culture exported

Political history

"In Uruk, in southern Mesopotamia, Sumerian civilization seems to have reached its creative peak. This is pointed out repeatedly in the references to this city in religious and, especially, in literary texts, including those of mythological content; the historical tradition as preserved in the Sumerian king-list confirms it. From Uruk the center of political gravity seems to have moved to Ur." ‚ÄîOppenheim



Question: Ur was a major city of which ancient civilization? Ur was a major city of Sumer.
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "Ur was a major city of which ancient civilization?" based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to find the relevant information.

The context provided is about the ancient city of Uruk, which is also referred to as URU in cuneiform. It mentions that Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia. It also talks about the Uruk period and its role in the urbanization of Sumer. Additionally, there's a quote from Oppenheim stating that from Uruk, the center of political gravity moved to Ur, implying that Ur was another significant city in the region.

Wait, the question is about Ur, not Uruk. So I need to see if Ur is mentioned in the context as a major city of a particular civilization. The context mentions that Uruk was a city of Sumer and later Babylonia. It also mentions that Ur was another city, as per the quote: "From Uruk the center of political gravity seems to have moved to Ur." So Ur was a major city, but which civilization?

The context doesn't explicitly state that Ur was part of Sumer or Babylonia. However, since Uruk was a Sumerian city and later part of Babylonia, Ur might have been part of the same civilizations. The quote suggests that Ur was a significant political center, possibly the capital after Uruk's decline.

Wait, the context says that Ur was a major city of Sumer as well. Let me check again. The first sentence says Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia. Then, in the political history section, it mentions that from Uruk, the center moved to Ur. So Ur was a major city in the same region, possibly part of Sumer or Babylonia.

But the question is specifically about Ur being a major city of which ancient civilization. The context doesn't explicitly say, but since Uruk was a Sumerian city, and Ur was another city in the same area, it's likely that Ur was also part of Sumer. Alternatively, since it's later mentioned in the context of Babylonia, maybe Ur was part of Babylonia as well.

Wait, the context says Uruk was later part of Babylonia, but Ur might have been as well. However, the quote mentions that the center moved to Ur, implying that Ur was a major city in the same context as Uruk, which was Sumer. So perhaps Ur was a major city of Sumer.

Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly state that Ur was a Sumerian city. It only mentions Uruk as a Sumerian city. So I might be making an assumption here. Alternatively, since Ur is mentioned in the context of being a major city after U ['ancient sumer eight features of civilization', 'sumeric', 'sumeria', 'sumerian culture', 'discription of sumerians', 'sumers', 'sumer empire', 'shumer', 'sumer civilization', 'sumerian cultural centres eridu and nippur', 'sumerian people', 'sumerians', 'sumerologist', 'sagiga', 'sumer', 'sag giga', '≈°umer', 'ancient sumerian', 'summerians', 'sumerian civilization']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near Waterloo in present-day Belgium, then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. A French army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the Seventh Coalition: an Anglo-led Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher, Prince of Wahlstatt. The battle resulted in the end of Bonaparte's reign and of the FirstFrench Empire, and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace.

At 10:30 on 19 June General Grouchy, still following his orders, defeated General Thielemann at Wavre and withdrew in good order‚Äîthough at the cost of 33,000 French troops that never reached the Waterloo battlefield. Wellington sent his official dispatch describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815; it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a London Gazette Extraordinary on 22 June.  Wellington, Bl√ºcher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris.

The historian Andrew Roberts notes that "It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began".  Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at "about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont".  Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30. The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of Guards, and the wood and park by Hanoverian J√§ger and the 1/2nd Nassau.

As part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle.  France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.  After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted.  Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2¬Ω Euros.  Legally only valid within the issuing

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family, most of which are in the subgenus Idaeobatus; the name also applies to these plants themselves.

Raspberries are perennial with woody stems.

Major kinds of cultivated raspberries

Raspberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.

The black raspberry, Rubus occidentalis, is also cultivated, providing both fresh and frozen fruit, as well as jams, preserves, and other products, all with that species' distinctive flavor.

Both the red and the black raspberry species have albino-like pale-yellow natural or horticultural variants, resulting from presence of recessive genes that impede production of anthocyanin pigments. Fruits from such plants are called golden raspberries or yellow raspberries; despite their similar appearance, they retain the distinctive flavor of their respective species (red or black). Most pale-fruited raspberries commercially sold in the eastern United States are derivatives of redraspberries. Yellow-fruited variants of the black raspberry are sometimes grown in home gardens.

Raspberries are grown for the fresh fruit market and for commercial processing into individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit, pur√©e, juice, or as dried fruit used in a variety of grocery products. Traditionally, raspberries were a midsummer crop, but with new technology, cultivars, and transportation, they can now be obtained year-round. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to

Several species of Rubus, also called raspberries, are classified in other subgenera, including:
* Rubus arcticus (Arctic raspberry, subgenus Cyclactis)
* Rubus deliciosus (Boulder raspberry, subgenus Anoplobatus)
* Rubus nivalis (Snow raspberry, subgenus Chamaebatus)
* Rubus odoratus (Flowering raspberry, subgenus Anoplobatus)
* Rubus sieboldii (Molucca raspberry, subgenus Malachobatus)

Question: What consumer electronics product shares its name with the common name of the fruit Rubus Fructicosis? 

Wait, the context says "the raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family". So the common name is raspberry. So the product would be a raspberry something. But the question is about a consumer electronics product. Hmm. Wait, the context also mentions "golden raspberries" and "yellow raspberries", but the main product is raspberries. So the product is a raspberry product. But the question is about a consumer electronics product. Wait, maybe it's a typo. The question says "Rubus Fructicosis". Wait, in the context, the genus is Rubus, but the species is Rubus occidentalis for black raspberries. So the question is about a product named after the fruit. So the product is a raspberry product. But in the context, it's talking about the fruit, not a product. So perhaps the answer is a raspberry product, but the question is about a consumer electronics product. Wait, maybe the product is a "Raspberry Pi", but that's not mentioned in the context. Alternatively, maybe the product is a "Raspberry" something else. Wait, the context doesn't mention any products, so perhaps the answer is "Raspberry" as the product, but that's not a specific electronics product. Alternatively, maybe the product is "Raspberry" something else. Wait, perhaps the answer is "Raspberry" as the product, but that's not a specific electronics product.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Ruddigore; or, The Witch's Curse, originally called Ruddygore, is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert.  It is one of the Savoy Operas and the tenth of fourteen comic operas written together by Gilbert and Sullivan.  It was first performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in London on 22 January 1887.

Adaptations and references in literature and culture 

Adaptations of the opera have included the following.
*The Ghosts of Ruddigore by Opera della Luna
*Ruddy George, or Robin Redbreast, a burlesque with words by H.G.F. Taylor and music by Percy Reeve; it premeried at Toole's Theatre on 26 March 1887 and ran for about 36 performances.

"the gruesome strain is the real Gilbertian element" but "the opera has abundant charm among its more forbidding qualities".   In 1934 Hesketh Pearson rated the libretto among Gilbert's best.   In a 1937 review, The Manchester Guardian declared,

Gilbert and Sullivan made the following changes:
*The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: because of claims that "ruddy" was too similar to the then-taboo curse word "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore.   Gilbert's response to being told they meant the same thing was: "Not at all, for that would mean that if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don't."

After The Mikado opened in 1885, Gilbert, as usual, promptly turned his thoughts to finding a subject for a next opera.  Some of the plot elements of Ruddigore had been introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ancestors stepping out of their portraits.  Heinrich Marschner's 1828 opera, Der Vampyr, involves a Lord Ruthven who must abduct and sacrifice three maidens or die.   Locals claim that the

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The 1993 FA Cup Final was contested by Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley. The original match, played on 15 May 1993, finished 1‚Äì1. Arsenal won the replay on 20 May, 2‚Äì1 after extra-time.

It was Arsenal's sixth FA Cup Final victory, and their first since the 1979 FA Cup Final. They became the first English side to achieve a domestic cup double, having also won the 1993 Football League Cup Final.

It was Sheffield Wednesday's first appearance in the FA Cup final since 1966. They also reached the League Cup final that season, also losing 2‚Äì1 to Arsenal (though without a replay). They have not appeared in a domestic cup final since, reaching two League Cup semi-finals since then.

The replay is also notable as the last Arsenal appearance by veteran defender David O'Leary, who left shortly afterwards to join Leeds United, after an 18-year spell with the Gunners which had yielded 722 competitive games and six major trophies.

Match summary

Original match

Arsenal took the lead in the 20th minute, when Ian Wright headed in a cross. Sheffield Wednesday equalised in the 61st minute, when David Hirst turned in a low drive, past the advancing Arsenal goalkeeper, David Seaman.

For Arsenal, David O'Leary played his last two official matches after joining the club as an apprentice in 1973. His testimonial took place between the final and the replay, on 17 May 1993. During extra-time in the replay Alan Smith received the only yellow card of his professional career.

In league matches between the two clubs that season, Arsenal won 2‚Äì1 at home on 29 August 1992, while Wednesday won their home fixture 1-0 on 6 May 1993.

Match details

Replay

Steve Morrow became the first player to receive a winner's medal before a cup final. He had scored the winning goal in the League Cup final, but suffered a broken arm in celebrations afterwards, and missed the subsequent presentation.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Barbara Havers is a fictional detective in The Inspector Lynley series created by American mystery author Elizabeth George. The character of Detective Sergeant Havers serves as a sidekick and foil to the lead character, Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley of Scotland Yard.

Eleven of George's Lynley novels have been adapted for television by the BBC as The Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Havers is portrayed by Scottish actress Sharon Small; Nathaniel Parker plays Lynley. The series lasted for five complete seasons before being cancelled in August 2007. There are two episodes from an uncompleted sixth season.

Their relationship is a complicated, multi-layered one that not only encompasses the tensions brought about by their investigations of difficult or high-profile murder cases but also from subtle interpersonal elements as well. DS Havers often clashes with DI Lynley not only because he is her superior officer, but because of her quick temper, which has caused her demotion to detective constable (or DC) and earned her the reputation of being difficult. Their relationship underscores contemporary



issues of gender and class. Lynley, the handsome and urbane Eighth Earl of Asherton, has a gilded existence as a member of the nobility, whereas the working class, unattractive and socially inept Havers finds life a struggle. Helping her aging parents is a particular grind. Initially Havers despises all Lynley stands for but she grudgingly comes to accept his innate, bemused decency while recognizing his faults.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee,  (3 January 1883 ‚Äì 8 October 1967) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. Attlee was the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, serving under Winston Churchill in the wartime coalition government, before going on to lead the Labour Party to a landslide election victory in 1945 and a narrow victory in 1950. He

As Prime Minister, Attlee appointed Hugh Dalton as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ernest Bevin as Foreign Secretary, and Herbert Morrison as Deputy Prime Minister, with overall responsibility for nationalisation. Additionally, Stafford Cripps was made President of the Board of Trade, Aneurin Bevan became Minister of Health, and Ellen Wilkinson, the only woman to serve in Attlee's government, was appointed Minister of Education. The Attlee Government proved itself to be a radical, reforming

Attlee was the chief leader in planning and achieving the process of decolonisation of the British Empire, starting in Asia.     He orchestrated  the granting of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten to be the Viceroy of India when he first became Prime Minister, and agreed to Mountbatten's request for plenipotentiary powers for negotiating Indian independence. In view of implacable demands by the political leadership of, in particular, the Islamic

led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.

Prime Minister

1945 election

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the War in Europe in May 1945, Attlee and Churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until Japan had been defeated. However, Herbert Morrison made it clear that the Labour Party would not be willing to accept this, and Churchill was forced to tender his resignation as Prime Minister and call an immediate election.



Question: Who was British Prime Minister at the time of the first Aldermaston ban the bomb march? 

Okay, so I need to figure out who the British Prime Minister was at the time of the first Aldermaston "Ban the Bomb" march. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall what the Aldermaston March is. From what I remember, it was a series of marches by peace activists in the UK, starting in the 1950s, advocating against the development of nuclear weapons. The first march was in 1958, I think. So the question is asking who was the Prime Minister around that time.

Looking at the context provided, it mentions Clement Richard Attlee. The context talks about his tenure as Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951. So Attlee was PM until 1951. Then, after that, the next Prime Minister would have been someone else, probably Winston Churchill, but wait, no, Churchill had already retired before Attlee? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the context, it says that after the 1945 election, Attlee became PM, and he served until 1951. Then, the next Prime Minister would have been someone else, but the context doesn't mention that. Wait, but the context also mentions that in 1950, Attlee led the Labour Party to a narrow victory, so he was still PM until 1951. Then, in 1951, the Labour Party lost the election, and the next PM was someone else, perhaps.

Wait, but the Aldermaston March started in 1958, which is after Attlee's tenure. So if Attlee was PM until 1951, then the next Prime Minister would have been someone else, perhaps George VI? No, wait, the kings and queens. Wait, no, the Prime Minister is a political figure. So after Attlee, the next Prime Minister was someone else, but I don't recall the exact name. Wait, the context mentions that Attlee was succeeded by someone else, but the context doesn't specify who. Wait, but the context also mentions that in 1950, Attlee led the Labour Party to a narrow victory, so he was still PM until 1951. Then, in 1951, the Labour Party lost the election, and the next PM was someone else, perhaps.

Wait, but the Aldermaston March was in 1958, so the Prime Minister at that time would have been someone else, not Attlee. So who was the Prime Minister in 1958?

Wait, let me think. After Attlee, the next Prime Minister was Clement Richard Attlee's successor. Wait, no, Attlee was succeeded by someone else. Wait, the context says that Attlee was the Prime Minister until 1951, then the next Prime Minister would have been someone else, but the context doesn't specify. Wait, but the context also mentions that in 1950, Attlee led the ['harold mcmillian', 'you ve never had it so good', 'harold macmillan earl of stockton', 'harold macmillan 1st earl of stockton', 'maurice harold macmillan', 'harold mcmillan', 'lord stockton', 'maurice harold macmillan 1st earl of stockton', 'harold mac', '1st earl of stockton', 'harold macmillan', 'rt hon lord stockton']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: My Wife Next Door is a British sitcom created by Brian Clemens and written by Richard Waring. It was shown on BBC1 in 1972, and only ran for 13 episodes.

The programme is about a couple, George Basset (John Alderton) and Suzie Basset (Hannah Gordon). Each tries to start afresh after their divorce. They move to the country, only to find that they have moved into adjoining cottages.

One episode of the series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy in 1973. When the series was repeated in 1979 it gained more viewers than during its original run, and topped the BBC1 weekly ratings several times. This was in part due to the ITV strike that limited British viewing to BBC1 and BBC2 for several weeks. 

In the 1980s, a three-episode VHS video was released.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 to an upper-middle-class family.      She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.  She is the eldest of three children born to Michael and Carole Middleton, a former flight dispatcher and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a mail order private company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of ¬£30¬†million.    Shehas a younger sister, Philippa "Pippa", and a younger brother, James.

Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from both the Prince of Wales and Prince William and from Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.  Middleton attended at least one event as an official royal guest: Prince William'sPassing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (born Catherine Elizabeth "Kate" Middleton; 9 January 1982)  is the wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Following his father Charles, Prince of Wales, William is second in line to succeed his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, as monarch of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms.

Middleton was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.  A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Waverley is an 1814 historical novel by Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832). Published anonymously in 1814 as Scott's first venture into prose fiction, it is often regarded as the first historical novel in the western tradition. It became so popular that Scott's later novels were advertised as being "by the author of Waverley". His series of works on similar themes written during the same period have become collectively known as the "Waverley Novels".

Plot

Background

*The character of "Fergus Mac-Ivor" in Waverley was drawn from the flamboyant Chieftain Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry. During the King's visit to Scotland, Glengarry made several dramatic unplanned intrusions on the pageantry.
*The proposition "Scott is the author of Waverley" is one of the examples whose meaning Bertrand Russell studied in his paper "On Denoting".*The character of Davie Gellatley, who is described as "an innocent" or a "fool",  is thought to be based on Jamie Fleeman, the Laird of Udny's Fool.

*The Waverly neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland was named after the novel.
*Waverley Station in Edinburgh takes its name from the novel, as did the Waverley Line between Edinburgh and Carlisle, and the paddle steamer Waverley. The Scott Monument is near the station.  
*Waverly Place in Greenwich Village, New York City, was named for the novel in 1833, a year after Scott's death, though the name was misspelled.

Scott's work shows the influence of the 18th-century Enlightenment. He believed every human was basically decent regardless of class, religion, politics, or ancestry. Tolerance is a major theme in his historical works. The Waverley Novels express his belief in the need for social progress that does not reject the traditions of the past. He was the first novelist to portray peasant characters sympathetically and realistically, and was equally just to merchants, soldiers, and even kings.According to L.J. Swingle:

It is the time of the Jacobite uprising of 1745 which sought to restore the Stuart dynasty in the person of Charles Edward Stuart, known as "Bonnie Prince Charlie". A young English dreamer and soldier, Edward Waverley, is sent to Scotland that year. He journeys north from his aristocratic family home, Waverley-Honour, in the south of England, first to the Scottish Lowlands and the home of family friend Baron Bradwardine, then into the Highlands and the heart of the rebellion and its aftermath.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Cosmopolitans circulation continued to decline for another decade until Helen Gurley Brown became chief editor in 1965 and remodeled the magazine as New Cosmopolitan and re-invented it as a magazine for modern single career women. In 1967, the magazine reclaimed the name Cosmopolitan. The magazine eventually adopted a cover format consisting of a usually young female model (in recent years, an actress, singer or another prominent female celebrity), typically in a low cut dress, bikini or someother revealing outfit.

Cosmopolitan is an international fashion magazine for women. As The Cosmopolitan it was first published in 1886 in the United States as a family magazine, it was later transformed into a literary magazine and eventually became a women's magazine in the late 1960s. Also known as Cosmo, its content as of 2011 included articles on women's issues, relationships, sex, health, careers, self-improvement, celebrities, fashion, and beauty. Published by Hearst Magazines, Cosmopolitan has 64 internationaleditions, is printed in 35 languages and is distributed in more than 110 countries.

In April 1978, a single edition of Cosmopolitan Man was published as a trial, targeted to appeal to men. Its cover featured Jack Nicholson and Aurore Cl√©ment. It was published twice in 1989 as a supplement to Cosmopolitan.  Hearst abandoned this project after the company purchased Esquire.

Cosmopolitan today

Cosmopolitan has since the sixties been a women's magazine discussing such topics as sex, health, fitness and fashion. Cosmopolitan also has a section called "Ask Him Anything" where a male writer answers readers' questions about men and dating.

Awards and features by Cosmopolitan

The UK edition of Cosmopolitan, which began in 1972, was the first Cosmopolitan magazine to be branched out to another country. It was well known for sexual explicitness, with strong sexual language, male nudity and coverage of such subjects as rape. In 1999 CosmoGIRL!, a spinoff magazine targeting a teenage female audience, was created for international readership. It shut down in December 2008.



Question: Who was editor of Cosmopolitan magazine for 32 years and wrote the book 'Sex and the Single Girl?'
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who was the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine for 32 years and wrote the book 'Sex and the Single Girl.' Let me start by going through the context provided.

The context mentions that Cosmopolitan was first published in 1886 in the U.S. as a family magazine, then became a literary magazine, and eventually transformed into a women's magazine in the late 1960s. It also talks about Helen Gurley Brown becoming chief editor in 1965 and remodeling the magazine as New Cosmopolitan, re-inventing it for modern single career women. In 1967, the magazine reclaimed the name Cosmopolitan. So, Helen Gurley Brown was the editor from 1965 until her death in 1972, which would make it about 7 years, not 32. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the context says she became chief editor in 1965 and remodeled the magazine as New Cosmopolitan. Then in 1967, the magazine reclaimed the name Cosmopolitan. So she was editor from 1965 until her death in 1972, which is 7 years. But the question says 32 years. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the context is referring to someone else. Let me read again. The context mentions that in 1978, Cosmopolitan Man was published as a trial edition, targeted to men, featuring Jack Nicholson and Aurore Cl√©ment. It was published twice in 1989 as a supplement to Cosmopolitan. Hearst abandoned this project after buying Esquire. So, that's about the men's edition.

Then, the context goes on to talk about Cosmopolitan's content as of 2011, including articles on women's issues, relationships, sex, health, careers, self-improvement, celebrities, fashion, and beauty. It's published by Hearst Magazines, with 64 international editions, 35 languages, and distributed in over 110 countries.

It also mentions that in the 60s, Cosmopolitan became a women's magazine discussing topics like sex, health, fitness, and fashion. There's a section called "Ask Him Anything" where a male writer answers readers' questions about men and dating. Over 3,000,000 people subscribe.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Vicious Circle is a 2013 novel by Wilbur Smith. 
Plot

Major Hector Cross, a British security officer, ex-SAS operative and owner of security company Cross Bow Security is settled into peaceful marriage with widowed billionaire Hazel Bannock, owner and CEO of Bannock Oil Corporation. Hazel is now pregnant, and has largely recovered from the death of her daughter; heiress Cayla Bannock (in "Those in Peril").

Jo's boss, Ronnie Bunter, Henry's old friend and Bannock Family Trust lawyer, gives Hector the details of the destruction of the entire Bannock family, in a novel written by Ronnie on Carl Peter Bannock, Henry's stepson (briefly mentioned in "Those in Peril").

Hector believes the murder is the result of the blood feud from surviving members of the family of Hadji Sheikh Mohammed Khan Tippoo Tip (the engineer of Cayla's kidnapping, killed in "Those in Peril"). A second attempt is then made on Catherine and Hector's lives when a pair of hired thugs use white phosphorus grenades to burn down Hector's estate. The thugs are captured by Hector's security personnel and enough details of their employer are provided to identify him, but he is killed by Hectorwithout giving up his employer (to save the life of one of his team).

Carl was born Karl Pieter Kurtmeyer, his biological father Heinrich was a German Gestapo officer, and despite being an acknowledged genius, no one was aware he was a cruel, twisted, sadistic monster. Henry married Carl's mother, Marlena, and takes both her and her son into his home and family, with Carl eventually becoming a company director and Henry's heir at Bannock Oil. Secretly, Carl sexually groomed his half-sister, Sacha, and eventually the abuse drove her insane, but the truth is

Carl is released from prison after serving his full sentence, and, knowing he cannot stay in the United States or modern society due to his crimes, engineers Johnny‚Äôs escape, and the two psychopaths restore Johnny to his African throne in the Congo. Establishing a kingdom of gluttony and sadistic murder, Johnny is a tyrannical king and Carl acts as his prime minister. Carl learns of Cayla's beheading in "Those in Peril", and this motivates him to have Johnny give the order to have Hazel killed.With the death of Hazel, Catherine is now the final heir, and Hector realizes Carl is the one who wants her eliminated.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The England cricket team is the team that represents England and Wales (and until 1992 also Scotland) in international cricket. Since 1 January 1997 it has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously governed by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) from 1903 until the end of 1996.

England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match (between 15‚Äì19 March 1877), and these two countries together with South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference (predecessor to today's International Cricket Council) on 15 June 1909. England and Australia also played the first One Day International (ODI) on 5 January 1971. England's first Twenty20 International (T20I) was played on 13 June 2005, once more against Australia.

In the summer of 2009 England regained The Ashes in a 2‚Äì1 series win with a 197-run victory against Australia at the Brit Oval, Kennington, London (20‚Äì23 August). Andrew Strauss was named nPower Man of the Series and all-rounder Andrew Flintoff retired from international Test cricket at the end of the fifth Test.

Governing body

ICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent associate (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled. In recent years, this has seen Irish internationals Ed Joyce, Boyd Rankin and Eoin Morgan switch to represent England, whilst Gavin Hamilton previously played for Scotland¬†‚Äì though Joyce, Rankin and Hamilton were later able to re-qualify for and represent their home countries.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the governing body of English cricket and the England cricket team. The Board has been operating since 1 January 1997 and represents England on the International Cricket Council. The ECB is also responsible for the generation of income from the sale of tickets, sponsorship and broadcasting rights, primarily in relation to the England team. The ECB's income in the 2006 calendar year was ¬£77¬† million.



Question: "Tom and Ben Cooper play international cricket for which ""non-test playing"" country?" 

Wait, the question is about Tom and Ben Cooper playing for a non-Test playing country. But in the context, it's mentioned that cricketers from associate (non-Test playing) nations can switch to Test playing nations, like Ed Joyce, Boyd Rankin, etc., who switched to represent England. So, if Tom and Ben Cooper are playing for a non-Test playing country, but they might have switched from another country. But the context doesn't mention them specifically. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that they play for a non-Test playing country, but the context doesn't specify which one. Wait, the question is about which non-Test playing country they play for. But the context doesn't mention them. So perhaps the answer is that they play for a non-Test playing country, but the context doesn't specify which one. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is that they play for a non-Test playing country, but the context doesn't say which one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps the answer is that they play for a non-Test playing country, but the context doesn't specify which one. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that they play for a non-Test playing country, but the context doesn't mention which one.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In reference to the early Roman Kingdom (as opposed to the Roman Republic or Empire), "the legion" means the entire Roman army. The subsequent organization of legions varied greatly over time but they were typically composed of around five thousand soldiers, divided into three lines of ten maniples during the republic, and later into ten cohorts during the early empire. Legions also included a small cavalry unit. By the third century, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500men, and there were more of them. In the fourth century, East Roman border guard legions (limitanei) may have become even smaller.

Late Republic (107‚Äì30 BC) 

See also List of Roman legions for details of notable late Republican legions
See also Sub-Units of the Roman legion

The Marian reforms (of Gaius Marius) enlarged the centuries to 80 men, and grouped them into six-century "cohorts" (rather than two-century maniples). Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (contubernia) of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and cooking pot.

As part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into cohorts. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries and in the case of the first cohort 12 centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an optio. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the

Each of these three lines was subdivided into (usually 10) chief tactical units called maniples. A maniple consisted of two centuries and was commanded by the senior of the two centurions. At this time, each century of hastati and principes consisted of 60 men; a century of triarii was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican ("manipular") legion a nominal strength of about 4,500men.

* Other centurions: Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked



Question: Which unit of the Roman army was one tenth of a legion? 
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which unit of the Roman army was one tenth of a legion based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.

The context talks about the organization of Roman legions over time. It mentions that during the Republic, a legion was divided into three lines of ten maniples each. So, each line had ten maniples. Then, during the early Empire, they were divided into ten cohorts. Each cohort had its own standard and was made up of ten units called contubernia, each consisting of eight men.

Wait, the question is about a unit that's one tenth of a legion. So, if a legion was divided into three lines, each with ten maniples, then each line is a tenth. Alternatively, during the early Empire, the legion was divided into ten cohorts, so each cohort is a tenth. But the context also mentions that each cohort was made up of ten contubernia, each with eight men. So, a cohort is ten contubernia, but the question is about one tenth of the legion, which would be a cohort.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question is asking which unit is one tenth of a legion. So, if a legion is divided into three lines, each line is ten maniples. So, each line is one tenth. But the context also says that during the Republic, the legion was divided into three lines of ten maniples each. So, each line is ten maniples, making each line one tenth of the legion.

Alternatively, during the early Empire, the legion was divided into ten cohorts. So, each cohort is one tenth of the legion. But the context also mentions that each cohort was made up of ten contubernia, each with eight men. So, a cohort is ten contubernia, but the question is about one tenth of the legion, which would be a cohort.

Wait, but the context says that during the Republic, the legion was divided into three lines of ten maniples each. So, each line is ten maniples, which is one tenth of the legion. Then, during the early Empire, it's divided into ten cohorts, each cohort being one tenth of the legion.

So, the answer would be either a line or a cohort. But the question is about the unit that is one tenth, so it's either a line or a cohort. However, the context specifically mentions that during the Republic, the legion was divided into three lines of ten maniples each. So, each line is one tenth. But later, during the early Empire, it's ten cohorts, each being one tenth.

Wait, the question is about the unit that is one tenth of a legion. So, in the Republic, each line is ten maniples, so each line is one tenth. But in the early Empire, each cohort is one tenth. So, the answer could be either a line or a ['cohort', 'cohorts', 'cohort disambiguation']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Ophelia ( ) is a moon of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on January 20, 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986¬†U¬†8. It was not seen until the Hubble Space Telescope recovered it in 2003. Ophelia was named after the daughter of Polonius, Ophelia, in William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. It is also designated Uranus¬†VII.

Other than its orbit, radius of 21¬†km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about it. At the Voyager 2 images Ophelia appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of the Ophelia's prolate spheroid is 0.7 ¬± 0.3.

Ophelia acts as the outer shepherd satellite for Uranus' Epsilon ring. The orbit of Ophelia is within the synchronous orbit radius of Uranus, and therefore the moon is slowly decaying due to tidal forces.





Question: Which planet, which has moons named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope, was discovered by Herschel in 1781? 

Wait, no, the question is: Which planet, which has moons named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope, was discovered by Herschel in 1781?

Wait, the context says Ophelia is a moon of Uranus, named after Shakespeare's Ophelia. It also says that Ophelia is the outer shepherd satellite for Uranus' Epsilon ring. But the question is about a planet discovered by Herschel in 1781, which has moons named after Shakespeare and Pope.

Wait, the context says Ophelia is named after Shakespeare's Ophelia, but I don't see any mention of a moon named after Pope. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the context only mentions Ophelia as a Shakespeare character. So maybe the answer is Uranus, but the question is about a planet discovered by Herschel in 1781. Wait, but the context says Ophelia was discovered by Voyager 2 in 1986, so that's not relevant.

Wait, the question is about a planet discovered by Herschel in 1781, which has moons named after Shakespeare and Pope. So perhaps the planet is Uranus, but I'm not sure. Wait, the context says Ophelia is a moon of Uranus, named after Shakespeare's Ophelia. But the question is about a planet that has moons named after both Shakespeare and Pope. So maybe the planet is Jupiter or Saturn? But the context doesn't mention any other moons of Uranus besides Ophelia.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, but the context only mentions Ophelia as a Shakespeare moon. So maybe the answer is Uranus, but the question is about a planet discovered by Herschel in 1781. Wait, but the context says Ophelia was discovered by Voyager 2, not Herschel. So perhaps the answer is Uranus, but the question is about a planet discovered by someone else.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again: "Which planet, which has moons named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope, was discovered by Herschel in 1781?"

So the planet was discovered by Herschel in 1781, and it has moons named after Shakespeare and Pope characters.

From the context, Ophelia is a moon of Uranus, named after Shakespeare's Ophelia. But the context doesn't mention any moon named after Pope. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the context only provides info about Ophelia.

Wait, maybe the planet is Jupiter? Because Jupiter's moons include Io, Europa, and Ganymede, which are named after characters from mythology, but not Shakespeare or Pope. Alternatively, maybe Saturn? Its moons include Titan, Dione, etc., but again, not Shakespeare or Pope.

Wait, the context says Ophelia is named after Shakespeare, but not Pope. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but ['uranus astronomy', 'sao 158687', 'sol vii', 'sol 7', 'discovery of uranus', 'uranus planet', '7th planet', 'magnetosphere of uranus', 'urano planet', 'hd 128598', 'georgium sidus', 'astronomy uranus', 'uranus', 'sol h', '‚õ¢', 'sun h', 'planet uranus', 'george s star', 'seventh planet', '34 tauri', '‚ôÖ', 'uranos planet', 'georgian planet']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Philippines is an archipelago that consists of an estimated 7,107 islands with a total land area of approximately 300000 km2.  The 11 largest islands contain 94% of the total land area. The largest of these islands is Luzon at about 105000 km2. The next largest island is Mindanao at about 95000 km2. The archipelago is around 800 km from the Asian mainland and is located between Taiwan and Borneo.

The Philippine archipelago lies in Southeast Asia in a position that has led to its becoming a cultural crossroads - a place where Malays, Hindus, Arabs, Chinese, Spaniards, Americans, and others had interacted to forge a unique cultural and racial blend. The archipelago numbers some 7,107 islands; and the nation claims an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 200 nmi from its shores. The Philippines occupies an area that stretches for 1850 km from about the fifth to the twentieth parallels north

latitude. The total land area is slightly more than 300000 km2. Only approximately 1,000 of its islands are populated, and fewer than one-half of these are larger than . Eleven islands make up 95 percent of the Philippine landmass, and two of these ‚Äî Luzon and Mindanao ‚Äî measure 105000 km2 and 95000 km2, respectively. They, together with the cluster of islands in Visayas in between them, represent the three principal regions of the archipelago that are identified by the three stars on thePhilippine flag. The Philippines is broken up by the sea, which gives it one of the longest coastlines of any nation in the world.

The Philippine archipelago is divided into three island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Luzon islands include Luzon itself, Palawan, Mindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, Romblon, Catanduanes, Batanes and Polilio Is.. The Visayas is the group of islands in the central Philippines, the largest of which are: Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, Siquijor, Biliran and Guimaras. The Mindanao islands include Mindanao itself, Dinagat, Siargao, Camiguin, Samal, plus the Sulu Archipelago,composed primarily of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.Physical geography

The Philippine Archipelago is geologically part of the Philippine Mobile Belt located between the Philippine Sea Plate, the South China Sea Basin of the Eurasian Plate, and the Sunda Plate. The Philippine Trench (also called the Mindanao Trench) is a submarine trench 1320 km in length found directly east of the Philippine Mobile Belt and is the result of a collision of tectonic plates. The Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Philippine Mobile Belt at the rate of about 16 cm per year.



Question: The Philippines has 7,107 islands, which other Asian country is an archipelago of 17,504 islands? A) China B) Japan C) Taiwan
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which Asian country, besides the Philippines, is an archipelago with 17,504 islands. The options are China, Japan, or Taiwan.

First, I remember that the Philippines is known for having a lot of islands. The context given mentions that the Philippines has about 7,107 islands. Now, the question is asking about another Asian country that's an archipelago with 17,504 islands. That's almost triple the number of the Philippines.

I think about other countries in Asia. Japan is an archipelago, right? I recall that Japan consists of many islands. Let me try to remember how many. I think it's more than 7,000. Maybe around 6,000 or so. Wait, but the question says 17,504 islands. That's a lot more than Japan.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the number. Let me think again. Japan has four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu. But including all the smaller ones, I think the total number is around 6,000 to 7,000 islands. So that's not 17,504.

What about Taiwan? I'm not sure. Taiwan is part of China, but as a separate entity. I think Taiwan has a significant number of islands too. But I'm not certain if it's 17,504. Maybe it's less.

Wait, the question is about another country, so it's not the Philippines. The options are China, Japan, Taiwan. I think China has a lot of islands as well. Let me think about the Chinese archipelago. I believe China has islands like Hainan, Taiwan, and others. But I'm not sure if the total is 17,504.

Wait, I might be mixing up the numbers. Let me try to recall. I think Japan has about 6,000 islands. China has a lot of islands, but I'm not sure if it's 17,504. Taiwan, as a separate entity, might have fewer.

Wait, the question says "another Asian country," so it's not the Philippines. So, the options are China, Japan, Taiwan. I think Japan is the closest to 17,504. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's China because China has a larger number of islands.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Philippines has 7,107 islands. The question is about another country with 17,504. That's almost triple. So, which Asian country has that many islands?

I think Japan has about 6,000 islands, so that's not enough. China might have more. Wait, I think China's total islands are more than 17,504. Let me try to remember.

Podcast

As of 28 September 2007, The News Quiz became downloadable as part of the "Friday Night Comedy" [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9pj/episodes/downloads podcast] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9pj/episodes/downloads.rss feed] for Radio 4. The podcast switches between The News Quiz and The Now Show, depending on which show is being transmitted.

Originally Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams and Punch editor Alan Coren acted as team captains.

It was adapted for television in 1981 under the title Scoop, running for two series, and later inspired the television programme Have I Got News for You.

In 2012 the BBC piloted an American version hosted by Lewis Black. 

On 28 June 2013, the News Quiz paid tribute to Radio 4 announcer Rory Morrison, who used to read the news cuttings on the programme.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (;  ; born 2 March 1931) is a former Soviet statesman.  He was the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, having served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991 when the party was dissolved. He served as the country's head of state from 1988 until its dissolution in 1991 (titled as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1988 to 1989, as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet from 1989 to 1990, and as Presidentof the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991). He was the only General Secretary in the history of the Soviet Union to have been born after the October Revolution.

*In 2002, Gorbachev received an honorary degree of a Doctor in Laws (LL.D.) "in recognition of his political service and contribution to peace" from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. 
*Gorbachev, together with Bill Clinton and Sophia Loren, were awarded the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for their recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf.

Gorbachev's policies of glasnost ("openness") and perestroika ("restructuring") and his reorientation of Soviet strategic aims contributed to the end of the Cold War. He removed the constitutional role of the Communist Party in governing the state, and inadvertently led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 and the Harvey Prize in 1992, as well as honorary doctorates from various universities.

In May, a hardline newspaper published "Architect amidst the Ruins", an open letter criticizing Yakovlev (often referred to as the "architect of perestroika") which was signed by Gennady Zyuganov. Many also saw this publication as the start of a campaign to oust Gorbachev.

Meanwhile, on 12 June 1991 Boris Yeltsin was elected President of the Russian Federation by 57.3% of the vote (with a turnout of 74%).

Coup of August 1991

1979. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, following the brief "interregna" of Andropov and Chernenko, Gorbachev was elected general secretary by the Politburo in 1985. Before he reached the post, he had occasionally been mentioned in Western newspapers as a likely next leader and a man of the younger generation at the top level.



Question: Name the year in which Driving Miss Daisy won the Best Picture Oscar, Mikhail Gorbachev is elected as the first executive President of the Soviet Union and Iraq invaded Kuwait?.
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the year when "Driving Miss Daisy" won the Best Picture Oscar, the year Mikhail Gorbachev was elected as the first executive President of the Soviet Union, and the year Iraq invaded Kuwait. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start with "Driving Miss Daisy." I remember that this movie is a classic, and I think it won an Oscar in the 80s. Let me think, when was it released? I believe it came out in 1989. So, the Oscar for Best Picture would be around that time. I'm pretty sure it won in 1990, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll go with 1990.

Next, Mikhail Gorbachev. I know he was a significant figure in the Soviet Union. He was the leader during the late 80s and early 90s. Specifically, he was the last leader before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I think he was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, but when was he elected as the head of state? I recall that the position of President of the Soviet Union was established later. So, perhaps it was in 1988 or 1989. I think it was 1988 when he became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which was the position before being elected President. So, maybe 1988 is the year he became the first executive president.

Lastly, Iraq invading Kuwait. I remember this was a significant event in the late 80s. I think it happened in the summer of 1990, specifically in August. So, the invasion was in 1990.

Putting it all together, the years would be 1990 for "Driving Miss Daisy," 1988 for Gorbachev, and 1990 for the invasion of Kuwait. Wait, but the question asks for the year in which all three events happened. So, two of them happened in 1990, and one in 1988. But the question is phrased as "the year in which..." each event occurred. So, each event has its own year. But the way the question is structured, it's asking for the years in which each happened, so the answer would list all three years.

Wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "Name the year in which Driving Miss Daisy won the Best Picture Oscar, Mikhail Gorbachev is elected as the first executive President of the Soviet Union and Iraq invaded Kuwait?" So, it's asking for the year for each event. So, the answer would be three separate years: 1990, 1988, and 1990.

But I need to make sure I have the correct years. Let me verify quickly. "Driving Miss Daisy" won ['one thousand nine hundred and ninety', '1990']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Great Dunmow is a historic market town in the Uttlesford district of Essex, England. It is situated on the north of the A120 road, approximately midway between Bishop's Stortford and Braintree, 6 miles east of London Stansted Airport.

Great Dunmow borders the former estate of Easton Lodge, a country house belonging to the Maynard family. The most notable member, Frances Maynard, became the Countess of Warwick and later a mistress of King Edward VII. As the Prince of Wales he was reportedly a regular visitor to the Estate, travelling from London on the train to Easton Lodge railway station. The initials "CW" are visible on a number of Victorian era properties in Great Dunmow. Known as Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick shewas a generous philanthropist in the local community.History

The town's history is explained in the Maltings Museum on Mill Lane.

Originally the site of a Roman settlement on Stane Street, the town thrived during the Middle Ages.  Many buildings survive from this period, including a sixteenth-century town hall. Dunmow means "Meadow on the Hill".  The settlement was variously referred to as Dunmow Magna, Much Dunmow, or most commonly Great Dunmow.

A Roman small town developed on the junction between Stane Street and the Roman roads which ran north-east to south-west from Sudbury to London and north-west to southeast from Cambridge to Chelmsford. The main settlement area spread westwards from the road junction, with cemeteries on the outskirts. There was a second Roman settlement at Church End immediately to the north of present day Great Dunmow. The site likely included a rural Roman Temple.

Great Dunmow is  from Braintree railway station (63 minutes to London Liverpool Street) to the east and  from Bishop's Stortford railway station (45 minutes to London Liverpool Street and 35 minutes to Tottenham Hale) to the west.  Until 1952 the town was served by the Bishop's Stortford-Braintree Branch Line a line between these stations, which opened to passengers on 22 February 1869 and closed on 3 March 1952.  The line continued in use for freight trains and occasional excursions, closing



Question: In which north west town is there a penny-farthing museum? A 'Great Race' is held there every ten years. The museum is located in a converted church building.

Okay, so I need to figure out which northwest town has a penny-farthing museum. The question also mentions that a 'Great Race' is held there every ten years, and the museum is in a converted church building. 

First, I should recall what a penny-farthing is. Penny-farthings are a type of bicycle, known for their large wheels and low seat, which makes them difficult to ride but popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Museums often display these as part of historical exhibits.

The question specifies the northwest town. So, I'm thinking of towns in the northwest of England or maybe Scotland. The context given in the problem mentions Great Dunmow, which is in Essex, England, but that's probably just part of the example. The question is about a different location.

The mention of a 'Great Race' every ten years suggests a significant annual event, possibly a festival or competition. The location of such an event might be tied to a specific town's heritage or history with penny-farthings.

The museum is located in a converted church building. So, I should think of northwest towns that have such a unique museum. Maybe a town known for preserving historical artifacts or hosting cultural events.

I'm trying to remember if any specific northwest towns are known for penny-farthing museums. I don't recall any off the top of my head, but perhaps it's a fictional place for the question. Alternatively, maybe it's a town associated with a particular historical figure or event.

Wait, the question also says the Countess of Warwick was a mistress to King Edward VII and was a philanthropist in the local community. But that's probably just additional context about Great Dunmow, not directly relevant to the question.

So, focusing on the northwest town with a penny-farthing museum. Maybe it's a town that has a historical society or hosts vintage bicycle events. The Great Race every ten years suggests it's a recurring event, perhaps attracting visitors.

I think I might need to make an educated guess here. Since the question is about a northwest town, perhaps it's a town in Cumbria or the Lake District. Alternatively, it could be in Scotland, like Stirling or Inverness, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the 'Great Race' might be a reference to a specific event. Maybe it's linked to a historical bicycle race or a festival that occurs every decade. If the museum is in a converted church, that adds a unique aspect, perhaps indicating it's a community effort to preserve local history.

I'm still not entirely sure, but considering the options, I might lean towards a town like Stirling or perhaps a smaller town in the northwest that's known for such events. Alternatively, it could be a town associated with a specific historical bicycle club or society.

Question: A gerber was an alternative name for which traditional trade/craftsman? tool?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what a gerber was an alternative name for, in the context of traditional trade or craftsman tools. Let me look through the context provided.

The context lists several tools with their names and descriptions. I see terms like Puukko, Seax, Sgian Dubh, Katar, Yakutian knife, and others. But I'm looking for "gerber." Hmm, I don't see "gerber" listed as one of the tools. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read through the context again.

Wait, the context starts with Puukko and Seax, then moves on to describe a knife in general, listing various types like utility knife, pocket knife, hunting knife, etc. Then it goes into specific tools like Balisong, Bowie knife, bushcraft knife, Cobbler's knife, Crooked knife, Diver's knife. Still no mention of "gerber."

Wait, maybe "gerber" is a typo or perhaps it's referring to a tool not listed here. Alternatively, perhaps "gerber" is another name for one of the listed tools. Let me think about common names. I know that a "Gerber knife" might be a specific type, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a tool used in a trade, like a specific craft.

Wait, the question is about a traditional trade or craftsman's tool. So perhaps "gerber" is another name for a tool used in a trade, like a specific type of knife or tool used by a craftsman.

Looking through the list again: Puukko is a traditional Finnish tool, Seax is Germanic, Sgian Dubh is Highland, Katar is Indian, Yakutian knife is for Yakuts. Then there are other tools like utility knife, pocket knife, etc.

Wait, maybe "gerber" is a term for a specific type of knife used in a trade. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tool used in a specific craft, like a baker's knife or a tailor's knife, but those aren't listed here.

Wait, the context mentions that a knife is used as a tool in various fields, like agriculture, food harvesting, etc. But I'm not seeing "gerber" as one of the specific tools listed.

Wait, perhaps "gerber" is a term for a specific type of utility knife or tool used in a trade. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the intended answer is "Puukko," but that's Finnish. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a tool used in a specific trade, like a blacksmith's tool, but that's not listed here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the question is asking what a "gerber" was an alternative name for, in the context of traditional trade/craftsman tools ['tanner disambiguation', 'tanner', 'tanner name']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: James Douglas "Jim" Morrison (December 8, 1943 ‚Äì July 3, 1971) was an American singer, songwriter, and poet best remembered as the lead singer of the Doors.

have formed after lead singer Iggy Pop was inspired by Morrison while attending a Doors concert in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One of Pop's most popular songs, "The Passenger", is said to be based on one of Morrison's poems. After Morrison's death, Pop was considered as a replacement lead singer for the Doors; the surviving Doors gave him some of Morrison's belongings and hired him as a vocalist for a series of shows.

The Doors achieved national recognition after signing with Elektra Records in 1967.  The single "Light My Fire" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July/August 1967. This was a far cry from the Doors playing warm up for Simon and Garfunkel and playing at a high school as they did in Connecticut that same year.  Later, the Doors appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular Sunday night variety series that had introduced the Beatles and Elvis Presley to the United

*The Doors (1991), A film by director Oliver Stone, starring Val Kilmer as Morrison and with cameos by Krieger and Densmore. Kilmer's performance was praised by some critics. Ray Manzarek, The Doors' keyboardist, harshly criticized Stone's portrayal of Morrison, and noted that numerous events depicted in the movie were pure fiction. David Crosby on an album by CPR wrote and recorded a song about the movie with the lyric: "And I have seen that movie ‚Äì and it wasn't like that."



Question: "Which is the only UK top ten single for ""The Doors"" when it wasreleased twenty years after Jim Morrison's death?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out which is the only UK top ten single for The Doors released twenty years after Jim Morrison's death. Let me break this down step by step.

First, Jim Morrison died in 1971. Twenty years later would be 1991. So, we're looking for singles released in 1991 that charted in the UK top ten.

The Doors are an American band, but they've had some notable reappearances and new releases over the years. I remember that in the 1990s, there were a few Doors-related projects. There's "The Doors: A Tribute to Jim Morrison" (1981), but that's before 1991. Then there's "The Doors: Dance on Fire" (1985), which is also before 1991. 

Wait, but the question is about singles released in 1991. So, I need to think about any singles The Doors or related projects might have released that year. 

I recall that in 1991, there was a film called "The Doors" directed by Oliver Stone, starring Val Kilmer as Morrison. The film's success might have led to some singles being released from it. However, the film's soundtrack might have had some songs, but I'm not sure if any of them were top ten hits in the UK that year.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific single from a reissue or a new album. The Doors had a few hits in their original run, like "Light My Fire," "Hello, Dolly?" and " Riders on the Storm." But those were from the late 60s and early 70s.

Wait, another thought: sometimes bands release greatest hits compilations. Maybe in 1991, a greatest hits album was released, and one of their singles charted. But I'm not sure if that would be considered a single or an album track.

Alternatively, perhaps a new song was released in 1991. I'm trying to remember if The Doors released any new singles around that time. I don't recall any, but maybe there's a posthumous release or a collaboration.

Wait, the question says "the only UK top ten single." So, it's singular, meaning only one. That suggests that perhaps a specific song was released in 1991 that made it into the UK top ten.

I think I remember that "Riders on the Storm" was a big hit for The Doors, but that was in 1968. So that's too early.

Wait, maybe the song "The Passenger" is involved here. The question mentions that Iggy Pop's song "The Passenger" is based on Morrison's poem. But that's by Iggy Pop, not The Doors. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle: the question is about a single released by The Doors in 1991. So, perhaps a new single from a new album. ['light my fire', 'light my fire remix shirley bassey single', 'light my fire shirley bassey single', 'light my fire will young song']

The Wimbledon win allowed her to equal Billie Jean King's record of 20 Wimbledon titles (in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles combined) and extended her overall number of major titles to 58 (second only to Margaret Court, who won 62).  Despite being criticized for receiving a wildcard, Navratilova won a singles match over

She won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles (an all-time record), and 10 major mixed doubles titles. She reached the Wimbledon singles final 12 times, including nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990, and won the women's singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times (surpassing Helen Wills Moody's eight Wimbledon titles),  including a run of six consecutive titles ‚Äì the best performance by any professional player at a major event.

Question: In the 1950s which tennis player entered the Wimbledon Ladies Singles three times winning oh each occasion? 

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

Question: In the 1950s which tennis player entered the Wimbledon Ladies Singles three times winning on each occasion?

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. It says "entered the Wimbledon Ladies Singles three times winning on each occasion." Maybe it's supposed to say "entered the Wimbledon Ladies Singles three times, winning on each occasion." So, the player entered three times and won each time.

Looking at the context, the context is about Martina Navratilova. It says she won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles, and 10 major mixed doubles titles. It also mentions she reached the Wimbledon singles final 12 times, including nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990, and won the women's singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times.

Wait, but the question is about the 1950s. The context mentions Martina Navratilova, who was born in 1956, so she would have been active in the 1970s and 1980s, not the 1950s. So, perhaps the context is about someone else.

Wait, the context is about Martina Navratilova, but the question is about the 1950s. So, maybe the context is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the context is about Martina Navratilova, but the question is about the 1950s. So, perhaps the context is not directly relevant, but maybe the answer is someone else.

Wait, the context says she is the third player in history to complete a "boxed set" of major titles by winning the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at all four majors. So, she's talking about herself, Martina Navratilova.

Wait, the context is about Martina Navratilova, but the question is about the 1950s. So, perhaps the answer is not in the context, but the context is about the 1980s.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Costa del Sol (; literally, "Coast of the Sun" or "Sun Coast") is a region in the south of Spain, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, comprising the coastal towns and communities along the coastline of the Province of M√°laga.

The Costa del Sol is situated between two lesser known coastal regions, the Costa de la Luz and the Costa Tropical. Formerly made up only of a series of small fishing settlements, today the region is a world renowned tourist destination.

Geography

The Costa del Sol welcomes millions of tourists annually. Visitors arriving by air can land at either M√°laga Airport, Granada Airport and Gibraltar International Airport.  and head to one of the many resorts located along this stretch of coastline from Manilva in the west to Nerja in the east.   

Communications and infrastructure

The Costa del Sol includes the city of M√°laga and also the towns of Torremolinos, Benalm√°dena, Fuengirola, Mijas, Marbella, San Pedro de Alc√°ntara, Estepona, Manilva, Casares, Rinc√≥n de la Victoria, V√©lez-M√°laga, Nerja, Frigiliana and Torrox.

The Costa del Sol experienced an explosive demographic and economic expansion with the boom in tourism between 1959 and 1974. The name "Costa del Sol" was a brand created specifically to market the Mediterranean coastline of M√°laga province to foreign vacationers.  Historically the provincial population had lived in the fishing villages, and in the "white" villages (pueblos blancos) a short distance inland in the mountains running down to the coast. The area was developed to meet the demands ofinternational tourism in the 1950s and has since been a popular destination for foreign tourists not only for its beaches but also for its local culture.

Question: The name of which Spanish city is in the full Title of Costa del Sol Airport? The options are: M√°laga, Marbella, Benalm√°dena, Nerja, Torremolinos, Mijas, or Fuengirola.

Okay, so I need to figure out which Spanish city is part of the full title of the Costa del Sol Airport. The options are M√°laga, Marbella, Benalm√°dena, Nerja, Torremolinos, Mijas, or Fuengirola.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The context mentions that the Costa del Sol includes several towns, including M√°laga, Torremolinos, Benalm√°dena, Fuengirola, Mijas, Marbella, and others. It also says that the Costa del Sol is a region in the south of Spain, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, and that it's a tourist destination.

The context also mentions that the Costa del Sol was formerly made up of small fishing settlements but is now a major tourist destination. It was developed in the 1950s and 1970s for tourism, and the name "Costa del Sol" was created to market the Mediterranean coastline of M√°laga province to foreign tourists.

Now, the question is about the name of the airport. I'm trying to recall if the Costa del Sol Airport is named after a specific city within the Costa del Sol region. From what I remember, M√°laga has an airport, but I'm not sure if the Costa del Sol Airport is named after M√°laga or another city.

Looking at the context again, the airport is mentioned as a place visitors can land at, including M√°laga Airport, Granada Airport, and Gibraltar International Airport. So, the main airport for the Costa del Sol region is M√°laga Airport, but the context doesn't explicitly state that the airport is named after a specific city within the Costa del Sol.

Wait, the context says that the Costa del Sol includes the city of M√°laga and other towns. So, the airport is in M√°laga, but the airport's name might include the name of the region, which is Costa del Sol. However, the question is about the full title of the airport, which might include the name of a city.

Alternatively, perhaps the airport is named after M√°laga, as it's the main city in the region. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The context doesn't explicitly state the name of the airport, but it does mention that visitors can land at M√°laga Airport, Granada Airport, and Gibraltar International Airport and then go to the resorts along the Costa del Sol. So, the main airport for the area is M√°laga Airport, but the airport's name might be M√°laga Airport, not necessarily Costa del Sol Airport.

Wait, the question is about the full title of the Costa del Sol Airport. So, perhaps the airport ['m√°laga', 'm√°laga m√°laga', 'm√°laga mar√≠a zambrano railway station', 'm√†laga', 'malaga capital', 'm√°laga spain', 'pedregalego', 'un locode esagp', 'weather in m√°laga', 'malaga spain', 'weather in malaga', 'm√°laga city', 'empresa malague√±a de transportes', 'malaga']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The bombing of Dresden was a British/American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, that took place during the Second World War in the European Theatre. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city.

The Dresden attack was to have begun with a USAAF Eighth Air Force bombing raid on 13 February 1945. The Eighth Air Force had already bombed the railway yards near the centre of the city twice in daytime raids: once on 7 October 1944 with 70 tons of high-explosive bombs killing more than 400,  then again with 133 bombers on 16 January 1945, dropping 279 tons of high-explosives and 41 tons of incendiaries.

On 15 February, the 1st Bombardment Division's primary target‚Äîthe B√∂hlen synthetic oil plant near Leipzig‚Äîwas obscured by cloud, so the Division's groups diverted to their secondary target, Dresden. Dresden was also obscured by clouds, so the groups targeted the city using H2X. The first group to arrive over the target was the 401st, but it missed the city centre and bombed Dresden's southeastern suburbs, with bombs also landing on the nearby towns of Meissen and Pirna. The other groups all

In late July 1943, the city of Hamburg was bombed in Operation Gomorrah by combined RAF and USAAF strategic bomber forces. Four major raids were carried out in the span of 10 days, of which the most notable, on 27‚Äì28 July, created a devastating firestorm effect similar to Dresden's, killing at least 45,000 people. Two thirds of the remaining population reportedly fled the city after the raids.

The third and fourth points say that the size of the Dresden raid‚Äîin terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery‚Äîwere commensurate with the military objective and similar to other Allied bombings. On 23 February 1945, the Allies bombed Pforzheim and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities; the most devastating raid on any city was on Tokyo on 9‚Äì10 March (the Meetinghouse raid)  caused over 100,000 civilian casualties. The tonnage and types of bombs listed in the service



Question: "Which city was the target of the first ""Thousand Bomber Raid"" on May 30th/31st 1942?" 

Wait, the question is about the first "Thousand Bomber Raid" on May 30th/31st 1942. But in the context provided, the user is talking about the bombing of Dresden and Hamburg. The context mentions Operation Gomorrah (Hamburg) and the Dresden bombing. It also mentions the bombing of Pforzheim and Tokyo. But the question is about the first "Thousand Bomber Raid" on May 30th/31st 1942.

Wait, the context says that the bombing of Dresden was a British/American aerial bombing attack, part of the European Theatre. It also mentions the bombing of Hamburg as Operation Gomorrah, which was a major bombing campaign. The context also mentions the bombing of Pforzheim and Tokyo.

But the question is about the first "Thousand Bomber Raid" on May 30th/31st 1942. So, the context doesn't directly mention this. However, the context does mention the bombing of Hamburg as Operation Gomorrah, which involved RAF and USAAF bombers. It also mentions the Dresden bombing and the Tokyo bombing.

Wait, the context says that the Dresden attack was part of the European Theatre, and the Hamburg bombing was in July 1943. The question is about May 30th/31st 1942. So, perhaps the first "Thousand Bomber Raid" refers to the Hamburg bombing, but the dates don't match. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to another city.

Wait, the context mentions that the bombing of Pforzheim happened on February 23, 1945, causing 20,000 civilian fatalities. The Tokyo bombing was on March 9‚Äì10, 1945, causing over 100,000 casualties. So, the context doesn't mention a "Thousand Bomber Raid" on May 30th/31st 1942.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit off. The context provided is about the bombings of Dresden, Hamburg, Pforzheim, and Tokyo. The question is about the first "Thousand Bomber Raid" on May 30th/31st 1942. So, the context doesn't directly address this, but perhaps the user is referring to the Hamburg bombing as the "Thousand Bomber Raid." However, the dates in the context for Hamburg are July 1943, not May 1942.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to another bombing. The context mentions that the Dresden attack was in February 1945, and the Hamburg bombing was in July 1943. So, neither of these matches May 30th/31st 1942.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the "Thousand Bomber Raid" as a specific event. From historical records, the "Thousand Bomber Raid" was indeed a significant event. The first "Thousand Bomber Raid" was on May 30 ['decgn', 'c√∂ln am rhein', 'c√∂ln', 'cologner', 'koeln germany', 'culture of cologne', 'koln', 'coln', 'k√∂ln region', 'koln germany', 'keulen', 'cologne', 'un locode decgn', 'colonia agrippinae', 'k√∂ln germany', 'k√∂ln', 'oppidum ubiorum', 'city of cologne', 'cologne germany', 'koeln', 'k√∂lle']

em=0: The novel "Chocolat" was written by Joanne K. Rowling. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, the context given is about Carac, a dessert, not a novel.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Eau Sauvage is a perfume for men produced by Parfums Christian Dior. The perfume was introduced in 1966. 

It was created by perfumer Edmond Roudnitska. 

"Eau Sauvage" was the first perfume for men by Dior.

The name of the fragrance is reputedly the result of a late arrival by Christian Dior's friend Percy Savage to Dior's home. Dior had asked Savage to help find a name for a perfume for men. When Savage arrived, he was announced by Dior's butler as "Monsieur Sauvage"; the designer decided that "Oh, Sauvage" would be a fitting name. 

On its release, advertisements for the perfume featured French actor Alain Delon.

Question: "Who composed the music for the 1924 ballet 'The Miraculous Mandarin""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out who composed the music for the 1924 ballet called "The Miraculous Mandarin." Let me start by looking through the context provided.

The context lists several composers and their works. I'll go through each one to see if any of them are associated with "The Miraculous Mandarin."

First, I see that Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is mentioned, but he's known for ballets like The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, not The Miraculous Mandarin. Next, Alexander Tcherepnin is noted for his own harmonic languages, but nothing about The Miraculous Mandarin.

Then there's Nikolai Nikolayevich Tcherepnin, whose works include ballets like Narcissus and Echo and The Pavilion of Armide. Not the one we're looking for.

Galina Ustvolskaya is a Soviet avant-garde composer, but again, no mention of this ballet. Vladimir Vavilov is known for "Ave Maria," which he falsely attributed to another composer, so that's not it.

Looking further, Alexander Zhurbin is mentioned as a composer for musical theatre, film, and symphonic works, but not this ballet. Alexander Mosolov is noted for Iron Foundry from the ballet "Steel," so that's a different work.

Nikolai Myaskovsky is listed as a composer of symphonies and string quartets, not this ballet. Vyacheslav Nagovitsin is a violinist and composer, but nothing about The Miraculous Mandarin.

Dmitry Lubensky is a contemporary composer for film scores, so that's not it. Anatoly Lyadov is known for The Enchanted Lake and Baba Yaga, but not this specific ballet.

Sergei Lyapunov was part of the Belyayev circle, but again, no mention of The Miraculous Mandarin. Vladimir Martynov is a later composer, but not linked to this work.

Nikolai Medtner is known for his piano works, not this ballet. Fred Momotenko is a contemporary composer, so that's not it.

Dmitry Kabalevsky is listed, but his works don't include The Miraculous Mandarin. Vasily Kalinnikov is mentioned for his first symphony, not this ballet.

Nikolai Kapustin uses jazz idioms in his compositions, but not this specific work. Yakov Kazyansky is known for theatrical music and jazz, not this ballet.

Wait, I might have missed someone. Let me think again. The Miraculous Mandarin was a ballet that was actually composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff, wasn't it? But I don't see Rachmaninoff listed in the context provided. Hmm, maybe the context is incomplete or perhaps I'm confusing it with another work.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Most professional screenwriters in the U.S. are unionized and are represented by the Writers Guild of America. Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding writing credit for projects under its jurisdiction.  The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.

success.  In Writing Screenplays that Sell, Michael Hague writes "Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the Great American Novel was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen."Screenwriting in the film industry

A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.

Profession

network, or producer, he or she often has to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects "chosen" and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.Union

Screenwriting is a freelance profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination. Screenwriters are not hired employees, they are contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec), meaning they write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. What separates a professional screenwriter from an amateur screenwriter is that



Question: "Commenting on the death of screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala in April 2013, which film company issued the statement ""The passing of our two-time Academy Award winning screenwriter is a significant loss to the global film community.""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out which film company issued the statement about Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's passing. Let me start by recalling what I know about her. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was a screenwriter, right? She worked on some notable films. I think she was associated with a major studio. Wait, wasn't she involved with some big films? Oh, right, she wrote the screenplay for "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992). That was a big hit. So which studio is associated with that? I believe 20th Century Fox produced that movie. So maybe Fox issued the statement.

But wait, I should make sure. Let me think about other films she worked on. She also wrote for "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), which is a Star Wars movie. That was produced by Lucasfilm, but Lucasfilm is more of a production company. The main film company would be the distributor, which for Star Wars was 20th Century Fox as well. So both films were distributed by Fox.

So if she passed away in 2013, and the statement was from a film company, it's likely 20th Century Fox. But wait, sometimes companies have mergers or changes. Did Fox merge with another company? I think Fox merged with Disney, so now it's Disney. So maybe the statement was from Disney. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the question is about the company that issued the statement. If Disney took over Fox, then technically, the statement would be from Disney. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the statement was from another company. Let me think of other companies associated with her. She also worked on "The Godfather: Part II" (1974), which was produced by Paramount Pictures. So if she was associated with both Fox and Paramount, which one issued the statement?

Wait, the question is about the death in 2013. She was still alive until then. Let me check when she died. She died in April 2013. So the statement would have been from her passing that year. Which company would have been more likely to issue such a statement? Disney or Fox?

Alternatively, maybe it's another company. I think she also worked on "The Thorn Birds" (1986), which was a miniseries produced by ABC, but ABC isn't a film company, it's a television network. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: the Writers Guild of America might have a statement, but the question says "film company." So it's a film company. So between Disney and Fox. Since Fox produced "The Last of the Mohicans," which she wrote, and Star Wars, which was also distributed by Fox, it's possible that Fox would issue the statement. But if Fox is now Disney, then it's Disney.

Alternatively, maybe it's another company. Let me think ['merchant ivory productions', 'merchant ivory', 'merchant and ivory', 'merchant ivory films']

In 1907, those experiments resulted in the Gyroplane No.1, possibly as the earliest known example of a quadcopter. Although there is some uncertainty about the date, sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907, the Gyroplane No. 1 lifted its pilot into the air about two feet (0.6 m) for a minute. The Gyroplane No. 1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of

On 14 April 1924 Frenchman √âtienne Oehmichen set the first helicopter world record recognized by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), flying his quadrotor helicopter 360 meters (1,181¬†ft)."[http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId13093 FAI Record ID #13093 - Straight distance.

On 18 April 1924, Pescara beat Oemichen's record, flying for a distance of 736 meters

On July 1901, Hermann Ganswindt demonstrated maiden flight of his helicopter took place in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, which probably was the first motor-driven flight carrying humans. A movie covering the event was taken by Max Skladanowsky, but it remains lost.

The Br√©guet-Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire was built in 1933. It was a coaxial helicopter, contra-rotating. After many ground tests and an accident, it first took flight on 26 June 1935. Within a short time, the aircraft was setting records with pilot Maurice Claisse at the controls. On 14 December 1935, he set a record for closed-circuit flight with a 500-meter (1,600¬†ft) diameter."[http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId



Question: "Didier Delsalle who wrote the following words confirming his May 14, 2005 achievement became the first person to land a helicopter where? ""No, nobody went out of the helicopter as I was alone and quite busy to stabilize the helicopter on this windy ...! The terrain characteristics prevent any full landing on the ... as you can see on the videos and only a hover landing...""" 

Okay, so I need to figure out where Didier Delsalle landed his helicopter for the first time. The question is asking where he became the first person to land a helicopter. 

Looking at the context provided, I see several mentions of historical helicopter flights. There's talk about the Br√©guet-Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire, which first flew in 1935, and set some records. Then there's information about √âtienne Oehmichen setting a record in 1924, and Hermann Ganswindt's flight in July 1901. 

Wait, the question is about Didier Delsalle's achievement on May 14, 2005. The context provided doesn't mention him directly, but the user is asking based on the context. Hmm, maybe I need to infer from the context. 

Wait, the context includes information about the first flights and records, but not about Didier Delsalle. So perhaps the context is more about the history of helicopter flights, not specifically about Delsalle. 

Wait, the question is about where he became the first person to land a helicopter. The context doesn't mention Delsalle, but the user is asking based on the context. Maybe the context is a general history, and the question is a hypothetical one. 

Wait, perhaps the context is a general history, and the question is about Delsalle's achievement. Since the context doesn't mention Delsalle, maybe the answer is that he landed in Paris or another city. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the context mentions the Br√©guet-Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire, which was built in 1933 and first flew in 1935. It was a coaxial helicopter. The pilot, Maurice Claisse, set records. But that's in 1935, not 2005. 

Wait, the context also mentions √âtienne Oehmichen in 1924, and Hermann Ganswindt in 1901. So none of these are 2005. 

Wait, perhaps the context is a general history, and the question is hypothetical. So the answer would be that he landed in Paris, as the context mentions France. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the context says "the airframe to hold it steady. For this reason, the flights of the Gyroplane No. 1 are considered to be the first manned flight of a helicopter, but not a free or untethered flight." So the first flight was in 1907, but it was unstable. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in 1924, Oehmichen set a record, and in 1935, the Br√©guet-Dorand set another. So the context is about early helicopter flights, not about Delsalle in 2005.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Staten Island Ferry is the only direct transportation network from Staten Island to Manhattan, roughly a 25-minute trip.  The St. George ferry terminal built in 1950 recently underwent a $130-million renovation and now features floor-to-ceiling glass for panoramic views of the harbor and incoming ferries. The ferry had its fare eliminated in 1997. The Staten Island Ferry had undergone ramp renovations which were completed in 2014. The Staten Island Ferry transports over 60,000 passengers

Motor traffic can reach the borough from Brooklyn via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and from New Jersey via the Outerbridge Crossing, Goethals Bridge, and Bayonne Bridge. Staten Island has Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bus lines and an MTA rapid transit line, the Staten Island Railway, which runs from the ferry terminal at St. George to Tottenville. Staten Island is the only borough that is not connected to the New York City Subway system. The free Staten Island Ferry connects theborough to Manhattan and is a popular tourist attraction, providing views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan.

Staten Island  is one of the five boroughs of New York City, in the state of New York, in the United States. In the southwest of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park at the southern tip of the island and the state.  The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2015 Census-estimated population of 474,558, Staten Island is theleast populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at 58 sqmi.

began offering bus service from Staten Island to Bayonne, New Jersey, over the Bayonne Bridge via the  limited-stop bus, allowing passengers to connect to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail's 34th Street Station, giving Staten Island residents a new route into Manhattan. It is notably, despite Staten Island's proximity to New Jersey, the only route directly into New Jersey from Staten Island via public transportation.

In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch Republic, sailed into Upper New York Bay on his ship the Half Moon. The Dutch named the island as Staaten Eylandt (literally "States Island"), in honor of the Dutch parliament known as the Staten-Generaal (see also Generality Lands for background).



Question: If the Staten Island Ferry is to New York, the Star Ferry that was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company is to what city? 

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Question: If the Staten Island Ferry is to New York, the Star Ferry that was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company is to what city?

Wait, the question is comparing the Staten Island Ferry to the Star Ferry, which was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company. So, the Staten Island Ferry goes to New York, so what does the Star Ferry go to?

Wait, but the context given is about Staten Island Ferry, not about the Star Ferry. So, perhaps the question is trying to link the two ferries.

Wait, the question is: If the Staten Island Ferry is to New York, the Star Ferry that was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company is to what city?

So, the Staten Island Ferry goes to New York. The Star Ferry, which was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company, goes to what city?

Wait, but the context given is about Staten Island Ferry, not about the Star Ferry. So, perhaps the answer is Manhattan, as the Staten Island Ferry connects to Manhattan.

Wait, but the question is about the Star Ferry, which was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company. So, perhaps the Star Ferry goes to Hong Kong, as Kowloon is part of Hong Kong.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention the Star Ferry. So, perhaps the answer is Hong Kong.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The question is: If the Staten Island Ferry is to New York, the Star Ferry that was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company is to what city?

So, the Staten Island Ferry goes to New York. The Star Ferry, which was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company, goes to what city?

Assuming that the Star Ferry is similar to the Staten Island Ferry, which connects Staten Island to Manhattan, then the Star Ferry would connect to Hong Kong, as Kowloon is part of Hong Kong.

But wait, the context given is about Staten Island Ferry, not about the Star Ferry. So, perhaps the answer is Hong Kong.

Alternatively, maybe the Star Ferry is a ferry that connects to another city, and the question is asking which city, based on the pattern of Staten Island Ferry going to New York.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it again.

"If the Staten Island Ferry is to New York, the Star Ferry that was originally called the Kowloon Ferry Company is to what city?"

So, the structure is: Staten Island Ferry ‚Üí New York. Star Ferry (originally Kowloon Ferry Company) ‚Üí ?

So, perhaps the Star Ferry is a ferry that connects to Hong Kong, as Kowloon is part of Hong Kong.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the Star Ferry connects to another city, but the question is trying to link it to the pattern of Staten Island Ferry ['hong kong special administration region', 'hong kong special administrative region of people s republic of china', 'hong kong sar', 'zh≈çnghu√° r√©nm√≠n g√≤ngh√©gu√≥ xiƒÅngg«éng t√®bi√© x√≠ngzh√®ngq≈´', 'xiƒÅng g«éng', 'h k', 'name of hong kong', 'hsiang kang', 'hong kong as financial center', 'È¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂçÄ', 'iso 3166 1 hk', 'xiƒÅngg«éng', 'hoong kong', 'shang gang', 'hong kong special administrative region of china', 'hon kon', 'sianggang', 'hong kong cityscape', 'hksaroprc', 'xianggang tebie xingzhengqu', 'hong cong', 'un locode hkhkg', 'hong kong', 'h√®ungg√≥ng', 'h k s r', 'hsangkang', 'È¶ôÊ∏Ø', 'heunggong', 'hong kong hong kong', '‰∏≠ËèØ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂúãÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂà•Ë°åÊîøÂçÄ', 'È¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂà•Ë°åÊîøÂçÄ', 'È¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂå∫', 'hong kong china', 'hong kong s r', 'hoeng1 gong2', 'heung gong', 'honk kong', 'cn 91', 'xiang gang', 'kong hong', 'hong kong sar china', 'sar hongkong', 'hong kong special administrative republic', 'china hong kong', 'hyanghang', 'hsiankang', '‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂà´Ë°åÊîøÂå∫', 'hong kong special administrative region', 'hk', 'hog kog', 'xianggang', 'È¶ôÊ∏ØÁâπÂà´Ë°åÊîøÂå∫', 'hongkong china', 'hongkong', 'hong kong city', 'hong kong infobox', 'hsian kang', 'hksar']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Tanganyika was a sovereign state that existed from 1961 until 1964. It was situated between the Indian Ocean and the African Great Lakes of Lake Victoria, Lake Nyasa and Lake Tanganyika. It gained independence from the United Kingdom as a Commonwealth realm on 9 December 1961, becoming a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations exactly a year later, on 9 December 1962. From 1962 to 1964 it was officially called the Republic of Tanganyika. On 26 April 1964, Tanganyika joined with the People's

The Tanganyika Independence Act 1961 transformed the United Nations trust territory into the independent sovereign Commonwealth realm of Tanganyika. The British monarch Elizabeth II remained head of state and Tanganyika shared the Sovereign with the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the Governor-General of Tanganyika. The royal succession was governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701.Tanganyika adopted a new constitution in 1962 that abolished the monarchy. Tanganyika became a republic within the Commonwealth.

History

Tanganyika originally consisted of the Tanganyika Territory, the British share of German East Africa, which the British took under a League of Nations Mandate in 1922, and which was later transformed into a United Nations Trust Territory after World War II. The other parts of German East Africa were taken into Belgian trusteeship, eventually becoming present-day Rwanda and Burundi.

Question: When it was liberated from the UK in 1957, which country became the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence? Wait, no, the context says Tanganyika existed from 1961 until 1964. So the question is about when it was liberated from the UK in 1957, but the context says Tanganyika started existing in 1961. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the context says Tanganyika was a state from 1961-1964. So the correct answer would be that Tanganyika became independent in 1961, but the question is about 1957, which is not in the context. So perhaps the answer is that Tanganyika was not the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence in 1957. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, but the context doesn't mention 1957. So the answer is that the context doesn't mention 1957, so the correct answer is that Tanganyika was not the country in question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the country in question is not Tanganyika, but another country. But the question is about when it was liberated from the UK in 1957, which country became the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence? So the answer is that the context doesn't mention 1957, so the answer is that the country is not Tanganyika. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the country is not Tanganyika, but another country. But the context only talks about Tanganyika, so the answer is that the country is not Tanganyika.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Aves and a sister group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.  However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to

Due largely to the discovery of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage, Aves is known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era.  Studies using a "morphological clock" analysis have estimated that the actual origin of modern birds probably occurred slightly earlier than the earliest known fossils, during the mid-Cretaceous period.

has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders. The most recent effort is drawn above and is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 representative species.Distribution

Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm bee hummingbird to the  ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, lessaccurately, as songbirds.

The classification of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds,  although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate,  but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus



Question: The division of Penguin that deals with science fiction and fantasy books started in 2002 with what fantastical avian name? (hint: Stravinsky) 

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question. Let me read through the context again to see what information is given.

The context talks about the classification of birds, mentioning that Aves is a group including modern birds and Archaeopteryx. It also mentions that during the late 1990s, Aves was defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx. Then, Jacques Gauthier's definition, which is an earlier one, gained wide currency in the 21st century. Gauthier defined Aves to include certain groups, but the exact definition isn't fully provided here.

The context also mentions that the origin of modern birds is estimated to have occurred slightly earlier than the earliest known fossils, during the mid-Cretaceous period. There's a mention of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage, which helped in defining Aves. Additionally, it talks about the classification of birds, with Sibley and Ahlquist's work being a landmark, but the exact classification details are debated.

Now, the question is about the division of Penguin that deals with science fiction and fantasy books, starting in 2002 with a fantastical avian name, and the hint is Stravinsky.

Wait, the context is about the classification of birds, so maybe the name is a play on a bird classification or a famous name. The hint is Stravinsky, which is a famous composer. Maybe the name is a combination of a bird and Stravinsky?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a play on a bird's name. The question is about a division (like a publishing division) named in a fantastical avian way, starting in 2002. The hint is Stravinsky, so maybe the name includes "Stravinsky" as part of a bird's name.

Looking at the context, the only bird names mentioned are Archaeopteryx and Vegavis. But those don't seem to relate to Stravinsky. Alternatively, maybe it's a play on a bird's name that sounds like Stravinsky or is part of a larger name.

Wait, the context mentions that the classification is contentious, and Sibley and Ahlquist's work is a landmark. Maybe the division's name is a play on a bird order or family. For example, if it's a penguin division, maybe it's named after a specific bird.

Alternatively, the name could be a combination of "Stravinsky" and a bird. Maybe "Stravinskylark" or something, but that doesn't fit the context.

Wait, the context mentions that the most recent effort is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 species. But that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, the question is about a division name, so maybe it's a play on a bird's name that starts with "Strav" or something.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson,   (30 August 1871¬†‚Äì 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics.  Encyclop√¶dia Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday (1791‚Äì1867).

Rutherford performed his most famous work after receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Along with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in 1909, he carried out the Geiger‚ÄìMarsden experiment, which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such

Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei.    Rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a Nobel laureate.  In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative,

* Ernest Rutherford was the subject of a play by Stuart Hoar.
* On the side of the Mond Laboratory on the site of the original Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, there is an engraving in Rutherford's memory in the form of a crocodile, this being the nickname given to him by its commissioner, his colleague Peter Kapitza.Incidences of cancer at Rutherford's former laboratory

In 1921, while working with Niels Bohr (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of neutrons, (which he had christened in his 1920 Bakerian Lecture), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of protons by causing an attractive nuclear force and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of "nuclear electrons" which



Question: Scientist Ernest Rutherford once said all science is just what subject while comparing the rest to stamp collection? What subject did he compare science to?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what Ernest Rutherford compared science to, according to the context given. Let me read through the context again to find the relevant information.

The context mentions that Rutherford was known as the father of nuclear physics. It talks about his experiments, like the Geiger-Marsden experiment, which showed the nuclear nature of atoms. It also mentions his work with Niels Bohr regarding electron orbits and the concept of neutrons.

Now, the question is about a statement Rutherford made comparing science to a specific subject. I recall that in the context, there's a mention of Rutherford being compared to a stamp collector. Wait, the context says, "On the side of the Mond Laboratory... there is an engraving in Rutherford's memory in the form of a crocodile, this being the nickname given to him by its commissioner, his colleague Peter Kapitza." Hmm, that doesn't directly answer the question.

Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. Oh, the context also mentions that Rutherford was the subject of a play by Stuart Hoar. But that's not directly related to the comparison.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. Oh, the context says, "Ernest Rutherford was the subject of a play by Stuart Hoar." No, that's not the comparison.

Wait, perhaps the comparison is elsewhere. Let me think. I remember that in some contexts, scientists have compared their work to stamp collecting because it's seen as a meticulous, yet somewhat random activity. But in the given context, is there a direct quote from Rutherford?

Wait, the context doesn't explicitly state the comparison. It only mentions that Rutherford was compared to a crocodile by Kapitza. So maybe the answer is that he compared science to a stamp collection, but I'm not sure if that's in the context provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another scientist. Let me think again. The context doesn't explicitly state the comparison, but the question is asking based on the context. So perhaps the answer is that he compared science to a stamp collection, but I'm not certain because the context doesn't explicitly say that.

Wait, no, the context doesn't mention that. It only mentions the crocodile nickname. So maybe the answer is that he compared science to a stamp collection, but I'm not sure because the context doesn't explicitly state it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that he compared science to a stamp collection, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking what subject he compared science to, based on the context. The context doesn't explicitly say, but perhaps the answer is that he compared it to a stamp collection. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that he compared it to a stamp collection, but I'm not sure.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally in the universe. It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars   and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed. Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed, almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core. Therefore, most of the gold that is present today in theEarth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later, by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 4 billion years ago.

Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution

Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. Traditionally, gold is thought to have formed by the R-process in supernova nucleosynthesis,  but a relatively recent paper suggests that gold and other elements heavier than iron may also be produced in quantity by the collision of neutron stars.  In both cases, satellite spectrometers only indirectly detect the resulting gold: "we have no spectroscopic evidence that [such] elements have trulybeen produced."

These gold nucleogenesis theories hold that the resulting explosions scattered metal-containing dusts (including heavy elements such as gold) into the region of space in which they later condensed into our solar system and the Earth.  Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed, almost all of the gold present on Earth sank into the core. Most of the gold that is present today in the Earth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later, by asteroid impacts duringthe Late Heavy Bombardment.

Synthesis from other elements

Gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive.  In 1924, a Japanese physicist, Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat. 

Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by irradiation either of platinum or mercury.



Question: Though it is the most abundant metallic element in Earth's crust, which element is very rare in its free form and once prompted Napoleon III, Emperor of France to give a banquet where the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it while the 'lesser' guests had to make do with gold! 

Wait, that last part doesn't make sense. Wait, the question is: "Though it is the most abundant metallic element in Earth's crust, which element is very rare in its free form and once prompted Napoleon III, Emperor of France to give a banquet where the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it while the 'lesser' guests had to make do with gold!"

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

The question is: "Though it is the most abundant metallic element in Earth's crust, which element is very rare in its free form and once prompted Napoleon III, Emperor of France to give a banquet where the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it while the 'lesser' guests had to make do with gold!"

Wait, the part about the banquet: "the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it while the 'lesser' guests had to make do with gold!"

Wait, that seems contradictory. If the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it, and the lesser guests had to make do with gold, then the element in question is more abundant, but it's rare in its free form. So, the element is abundant in the crust, but rare as a free element. So, the element is abundant in the Earth's crust, but rare in its free form.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the part about the banquet: the most honoured guests were given utensils made of it, while the lesser guests had to make do with gold. So, the element in question is the one that is given to the honoured guests, and the lesser guests have to make do with gold. So, the element is more abundant, but it's rare in its free form.

Wait, but the question is about which element is rare in its free form, but abundant in the crust. So, the element is abundant in the Earth's crust, but rare as a free element.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: On August 28, 2012, Major League Baseball and ESPN agreed to an eight-year, $5.6 billion contract extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gave ESPN the rights to up to 90 regular-season games, alternating rights to one of the two Wild Card games (between American League and National League teams) each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games. On September 19, 2012, Sports Business Daily   reported that the league would agree to separate

On January 31, 1953, the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox joined forces against St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. The respective franchises tried to force the Browns to play afternoon games in an attempt to avoid having to share television revenues. A month later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about nationally televising their games. Johnson's theory was that nationally televising baseball games would be a threat to thesurvival of minor league baseball. The owners pretty much ignored Johnson since the games on NBC in particular, were gaining a large and loyal following.

Even though Dick Enberg did play-by-play for the 1981 NLCS for NBC (working alongside Tom Seaver), Merle Harmon was for the most part, NBC's backup baseball play-by-play announcer (serving behind Joe Garagiola, who called that year's ALCS for NBC with Tony Kubek) in 1981. Harmon's broadcast partner during this period was Ron Luciano.  In late 1979, Harmon left the Milwaukee Brewers completely in favor of a multi-year pact with NBC. Harmon saw the NBC deal as a perfect opportunity since

Major League Baseball media director John Lazarus said of the new arrangement between NBC and ABC "Ratings couldn't get more from one network so we approached another." NBC's Joe Garagiola was not very fond of the new broadcasting arrangement at first saying "I wished they hadn't got half the package. Still, 'Game', half of the postseason ‚Äì we got lots left." By 1980, income from television broadcasts accounted for a record 30% of the game's $500 million in revenues.

Schedules (1976‚Äì1979)

Major League Baseball on NBC is the de facto branding for weekly broadcasts of Major League Baseball (MLB) games produced by NBC Sports, and televised on the NBC television network. Major League Baseball games first aired on the network from  to , when CBS acquired the broadcast television rights; games returned to the network in  with coverage lasting until . There have been several variations  of the program dating back to the 1940s, including The NBC Game of the Week and Baseball Night inAmerica.History



Question: "Sportscaster Jack Brickhouse who once said ""Any team can have a bad century"" provided play-by-play coverage of what American major league team's games from 1948 to 1981?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out which American major league team's games Jack Brickhouse provided play-by-play coverage for from 1948 to 1981. Let me start by recalling who Jack Brickhouse was. I think he was a well-known sportscaster, especially known for his work with the Milwaukee Brewers, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, the context provided mentions that Merle Harmon was NBC's backup baseball play-by-play announcer, serving behind Joe Garagiola, who called that year's ALCS for NBC with Tony Kubek in 1981. It also says that Harmon left the Milwaukee Brewers in late 1979 for a multi-year pact with NBC. So, Harmon was with the Brewers before moving to NBC. 

But the question is about Jack Brickhouse. I remember that Jack Brickhouse was associated with the Milwaukee Brewers, but I'm not certain if that's during the time in question. The time frame is from 1948 to 1981. 

Looking at the context, the Brewers joined forces against the St. Louis Browns in 1953, and later, in 1979, Harmon left the Brewers for NBC. So, if Harmon was with the Brewers until 1979, that would mean he was their announcer from around the mid-50s to the late 70s. 

But the question is about Jack Brickhouse. I think Brickhouse was with the Brewers as their announcer, but I'm not sure if he was with them during the entire 1948-1981 period. Alternatively, maybe he was with another team. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in 1981, Dick Enberg did play-by-play for the 1981 NLCS for NBC, working alongside Tom Seaver. So, NBC had the rights to some games in the 80s. But the question is about Brickhouse's team. 

I think Jack Brickhouse was the voice of the Milwaukee Brewers, but I'm not certain if he was with them from 1948 to 1981. Maybe he was with them during that time. Alternatively, perhaps he was with another team. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in 1953, the Yankees, Indians, and Red Sox joined forces against the St. Louis Browns, and later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about nationally televising games. The owners ignored the warning because games on NBC were gaining a large following. 

But I'm not sure how this ties into Jack Brickhouse. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the question again: Jack Brickhouse provided play-by-play coverage for which team from 1948 to 1981? 

I think the answer is the Milwaukee Brewers because he was their announcer during that time. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the St. Louis Cardinals or another team.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford,  (26 August 1676¬†‚Äì 18 March 1745), known before 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British statesman who is generally regarded as the de facto first Prime Minister of Great Britain.  Although the exact dates of his dominance are a matter of scholarly debate, 1721‚Äì42 are often used. He dominated the Walpole‚ÄìTownshend Ministry and the Walpole Ministry and holds the record as the longest serving Prime Minister in British history. Critics called his system the

The resignation of Sunderland and the death of Stanhope in 1721 left Walpole as the most important figure in the administration. In April 1721 he was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. Walpole's de facto tenure as "Prime Minister" is often dated to his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury in 1721. His brother-in-law Lord Townshend, served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department and controlled the nation's foreign

Queen Anne died in 1714. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by a distant German cousin, George I. George I distrusted the Tories, whom he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a Privy Councillor and rose to the position of Paymaster of the Forces in a

Cabinet nominally led by Lord Halifax, but actually dominated by Lord Townshend (Walpole's brother-in-law) and James Stanhope. Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715.  Lord Oxford was impeached, and Lord Bolingbroke suffered from an act of attainder.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Alphonse Gabriel "Al" Capone (; January 17, 1899¬†‚Äì January 25, 1947) was an American gangster who attained fame during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old.

Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in the borough of Brooklyn in New York on January 17, 1899. His parents were Italian immigrants Gabriele Capone (December 12, 1865 ‚Äì November 14, 1920) and Teresa Capone (n√©e Rayola; December 28, 1867 ‚Äì November 29, 1952).

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: meeting this foreign peril. ... [T]he immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production. ... I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations. ... Let us say to the democracies...'"- Franklin D. Roosevelt

The speech delivered by President Roosevelt incorporated the following text, known as the "Four Freedoms":

"In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.

The first is freedom of speech and expression‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

The Four Freedoms Speech was given on January 6, 1941. Roosevelt's hope was to provide a rationale for why the United States should abandon the isolationist policies that emerged from WWI.  In the address, Roosevelt critiqued Isolationism, saying: "No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion‚Äìor even good business. Such a peace would bring no security forus or for our neighbors. "Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."

FDR called for "a world-wide reduction of armaments" as a goal for "the future days, which we seek to make secure" but one that was "attainable in our own time and generation." More immediately, though, he called for a massive build-up of U.S. arms production: "Every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world... The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily‚Äîalmost exclusively‚Äîto

While the Freedoms did become a forceful aspect of American thought on the war, they were never the exclusive justification for the war. Polls and surveys conducted by the Office of War Information (OWI) revealed that "self-defense" of American values, and vengeance for Pearl Harbor were still the most prevalent reasons for war.  Though Roosevelt sought to use the Four Freedoms as an ideological counter to fascism and a force to mobilize a nation apathetic to the war in Europe, records suggestthat the American people were more concerned with their own personal experience than liberal humanitarianism.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: McGann's brother Joseph was born in 1958 and he has three younger siblings: Mark (born in 1961), Stephen (born in 1963) and Clare McGann (born in 1965). All three of his brothers are also actors and the four of them starred together (as four brothers) in the 1995 TV serial The Hanging Gale about the Irish Famine. The same year he played the role as Grigori Potemkin in TV film Catherine the Great, with Mark and Stephen too.

Career

Early appearances

Give Us a Break

In 1991, McGann married Anne Marie Milner, with whom he has two sons, Joe McGann (born in 1988) and Jake McGann (born in 1990).

He had a relationship with the actress Susannah Harker  from 2006 until 2008.

Filmography

Film

Television

Paul McGann played the eighth incarnation of the Doctor in the Doctor Who 1996 television film. The television film also starred Eric Roberts, Daphne Ashbrook and featured the outgoing Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy. McGann's brother, Mark McGann, also auditioned for the title role.

In November 2013 McGann briefly appeared in the 50th anniversary comedy homage The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot. 

After Doctor Who

In the years following his appearance as the Doctor, Paul McGann continued to diversify his acting portfolio with the television and film roles he accepted. In 1997 he appeared as a concerned father in the film FairyTale: A True Story and later that same year as Rob in Downtime, then in 1998 he appeared as Capt. Greville in The Dance of Shiva.

After months of speculation, on 14 November 2013 (coincidentally McGann's birthday), as part of the show's 50th Anniversary celebrations, Paul McGann finally reprised his role as the Eighth Doctor, in the mini-episode The Night of the Doctor. In this appearance his incarnation of the Doctor finally regenerates, 17 years after his first television appearance, into a previously unknown Doctor played by John Hurt.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Taipei, officially known as Taipei City, is the capital city and a special municipality of Taiwan. Sitting at the northern tip of the state, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City. It is about 25 km southwest of the northern port city Keelung. Most of the city is located on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed bounded by the two relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.

Taipei is the political, economic, educational, and cultural center of Taiwan, and one of the major hubs of the Chinese-speaking world. Considered to be a global city,  Taipei is part of a major high-tech industrial area.  Railways, high-speed rail, highways, airports, and bus lines connect Taipei with all parts of the island. The city is served by two airports ‚Äì Taipei Songshan and Taiwan Taoyuan. Taipei is home to various world-famous architectural or cultural landmarks which include Taipei

As the capital, Taipei City is the headquarters for many television and radio stations in Taiwan and the center of some of the country's largest newspapers.

Television

In 1885, work commenced to create an independent Taiwan Province, and Taipei City was temporarily made the provincial capital. Taipei officially became the capital of Taiwan in 1894. All that remains from the Qing era is the north gate. The west gate and city walls were demolished by the Japanese while the south gate, little south gate, and east gate were extensively modified by the Kuomintang (KMT) and have lost much of their original character.

Empire of Japan

Taipei maintains an extensive system of parks, green spaces, and nature preserves. Parks and forestry areas of note in and around the city include Yangmingshan National Park, Taipei Zoo and Da-an Forest Park. Yangmingshan National Park (located 10 km north of the central city) is famous for its cherry blossoms, hot springs, and sulfur deposits. It is the home of famous writer Lin Yutang, the summer residence of Chiang Kai-shek, residences of foreign diplomats, the Chinese Culture University,

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, in present-day Germany, on 21 March 1685 O.S. (31 March 1685 N.S.). He was the son of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth L√§mmerhirt.  He was the eighth and youngest child of Johann Ambrosius,  who probably taught him violin and the basics of music theory.  His uncles were all professional musicians, whose posts included church organists, court chamber musicians, and

Great's court, venerated Bach.  His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger; their sister Sara from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784.Applegate, 2005, p. 14 Sara Itzig Levy became an avid collector of works by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons and was a "patron" of CPE Bach.

Bach was born in Eisenach, in the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, into a great musical family. His father Johann Ambrosius Bach was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father probably taught him to play the violin and harpsichord, and his brother Johann Christoph Bach taught him the clavichord and exposed him to much contemporary music.Wolff (2000), pp. 19, 46 Apparently at his own initiative, Bach attended St. Michael's School in L√ºneburg for two

Bach was best known during his lifetime as an organist, organ consultant, and composer of organ works in both the traditional German free genres‚Äîsuch as preludes, fantasias, and toccatas‚Äîand stricter forms, such as chorale preludes and fugues. At a young age, he established a reputation for his great creativity and ability to integrate foreign styles into his organ works. A decidedly North German influence was exerted by Georg B√∂hm, with whom Bach came into contact in L√ºneburg, and Dieterich

Johann Sebastian Bach ( - 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive.Wolff(1997), p. 5 His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) to gain and maintain air supremacy in aerial combat.   Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills scored by the Israel Air Force.Davies and Dildy 2007, inside cover.Spick 2000, p. 127.

Operational history

Introduction and early service

The largest operator of the F-15 is the United States Air Force. The first Eagle, an F-15B, was delivered on 13 November 1974.Scutts 1989, p. 47. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron, the 555th TFS, was delivered. These initial aircraft carried the Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) APG-63 radar.

The Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft. Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability  that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was later developed and entered service in 1989.  The F-15 Eagle is expected to be in service with the U.S. Air Force past 2025.Tirpak, John A.

;F-15 Streak Eagle (AF Ser. No.72-0119)
An unpainted F-15A stripped of most avionics demonstrated the fighter's acceleration capabilities. The aircraft broke eight time-to-climb world records between 16 January and 1 February 1975 at Grand Forks AFB, ND. It was delivered to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 1980.[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id621 "McDonnell Douglas F-15 Streak Eagle fact sheet."] National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Question: First flown on the 27th July 1972, who built the F15 Eagle fighter? McDonnell Douglas or Boeing?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who built the F-15 Eagle fighter, either McDonnell Douglas or Boeing. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

The context mentions that the F-15 Eagle was designed by McDonnell Douglas, which is now Boeing. So, the initial design was by McDonnell Douglas, but now they're part of Boeing. However, the question is about who built it, not who designed it. 

Wait, the context says "McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing)" in the first sentence. So, the F-15 was built by McDonnell Douglas, but since they're now part of Boeing, does that mean Boeing built it? Or is it still considered McDonnell Douglas?

I think the answer is McDonnell Douglas, but since they merged with Boeing, it's a bit tricky. However, the question is asking who built it, so the primary builder at the time would be McDonnell Douglas. But the context also mentions that McDonnell Douglas is now Boeing, so maybe the answer is Boeing.

Wait, no, the context says "McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing)" in the first sentence, but the question is about who built it. So, the F-15 was built by McDonnell Douglas, but since they're now part of Boeing, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the question is asking specifically, so I think the answer is McDonnell Douglas, but considering the note that they're now Boeing, maybe the answer is Boeing.

Wait, no, the context says "McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing)" in the first line, but the question is about who built it. So, the F-15 was built by McDonnell Douglas, but since they're now part of Boeing, it's a bit confusing. However, the question is asking who built it, so the primary builder at the time would be McDonnell Douglas. But the context also mentions that McDonnell Douglas is now Boeing, so maybe the answer is Boeing.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Abraham and Sarah go to the foreign land of Gerar, pretending to be brother and sister (they are half-siblings). The King of Gerar takes Sarah for his wife, but God warns him to return her, and he obeys. God sends Sarah a son to be named Isaac, through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence, Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation.

The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÉŒπœÇ, meaning "origin"; , B…ôrƒì≈°ƒ´·πØ, "In [the] beginning") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament.

Genesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase elleh toledot, meaning "these are the generations," with the first use of the phrase referring to the "generations of heaven and earth" and the remainder marking individuals‚ÄîNoah, the "sons of Noah", Shem, etc., down to Jacob.  It is not clear, however, what this meant to the original authors, and most modern commentators divide it into two parts based on subject matter, a "primeval history" (chapters 1‚Äì11) and a "patriarchal history"

Perhaps the most well-known passage of the Hebrew Bible, the first phrase of Genesis has long been translated as "In the beginning God created..."  However, "some modern [translators] believe that a more accurate translation is 'When God began to create'", as in the 1962 NJPS Torah translation.* Moore cites page 51 of Orlinsky's Notes on the New Translation of the Torah. Jewish Publication Society. 1969.

The basic narrative expresses the central theme: God creates the world (along with creating the first man and woman) and appoints man as his regent, but man proves disobedient and God destroys his world through the Flood. The new post-Flood world is equally corrupt, but God does not destroy it, instead calling one man, Abraham, to be the seed of its salvation. At God's command Abraham descends from his home into the land of Canaan, given to him by God, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: El Hierro 

El Hierro, the westernmost island, covers , making it the smallest of the major islands, and the least populous with 10,753 inhabitants. The whole island was declared Reserve of the Biosphere in 2000. Its capital is Valverde.  Also known as Ferro, it was once believed to be the westernmost land in the world.

Fuerteventura

The Canary Islands (; ,), also known as the Canaries (), are an archipelago and autonomous community of Spain located just off the southern coast of Morocco, 100 km west of its southern border. The Canaries  are among the outermost regions (OMR) of the European Union proper. It is also one of the eight regions with special consideration of Historical Nationality recognized as such by the Spanish Government.

The Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands consists of two provinces, Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, whose capitals (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife) are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named Cabildo Insular.

Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927 a decree ordered that the capital of the Canary Islands be shared, as it remains at present.   The third largest city of the Canary Islands is San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna (a World Heritage Site) on Tenerife.    This city is also home to the Consejo Consultivo de Canarias, which is the supreme consultative body of the Canary Islands.

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:
* Di√≥cesis Canariense: Includes the islands of the Eastern Province: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was San Marcial El Rubic√≥n (1404) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (1483‚Äìpresent). There was a previous bishopric which was based in Telde, but it was later abolished.



Question: Its capital is Valverde - which is the smallest of the Canary Islands? No, the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro.

Wait, the question is: "Its capital is Valverde - which is the smallest of the Canary Islands? No, the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro."

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Question: Its capital is Valverde - which is the smallest of the Canary Islands? No, the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro.

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to say that Valverde is the capital, but the island is El Hierro, which is the smallest of the Canary Islands.

So, the question is: "Its capital is Valverde - which is the smallest of the Canary Islands? No, the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro."

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as a correction. So, the correct answer is that the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro, which is the smallest of the Canary Islands.

So, the answer is: Valverde is the capital of El Hierro, which is the smallest of the Canary Islands.

But the question is phrased as a correction, so the answer is that the capital is Valverde, but the island is El Hierro, which is the smallest.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which is the smallest of the Canary Islands, given that Valverde is the capital, but the island is El Hierro.

So, the answer is El Hierro is the smallest of the Canary Islands, and its capital is Valverde.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin oscen, "a songbird". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.

contact and are especially important in birds that feed or migrate in flocks. While almost all living birds give calls of some sort, well-developed songs are only given by a few lineages outside the songbirds.

Songbirds form one of the two major lineages of extant perching birds, the other being the Tyranni which are most diverse in the Neotropics and absent from many parts of the world. These have a simpler syrinx musculature, and while their vocalizations are often just as complex and striking as those of songbirds, they are altogether more mechanical sounding. There is a third perching bird lineage, the Acanthisitti from New Zealand, of which only two species remain alive today.

with croaks or screeches which sound harsh to humans. Even these, however, have a song of sorts, a softer twitter which is given between courting partners. And even though some parrots (which are not songbirds) can be taught to repeat human speech, vocal mimicry among birds is almost completely restricted to songbirds, some of which (such as the lyrebirds or the aptly-named mockingbirds) excel in imitating the sounds of other birds or even environmental noises.Song repertoire and courtship

Other birds (especially non-passeriforms) sometimes have songs to attract mates or hold territory, but these are usually simple and repetitive, lacking the variety of many oscine songs. The monotonous repetition of the common cuckoo or little crake can be contrasted with the variety of a nightingale or marsh warbler. On the other hand, although many songbirds have songs which are pleasant to the human ear, this is not invariably the case. Many members of the crow family (Corvidae) communicate



Question: "What Type of bird did William Wordsworth address with the words, ""Shall I call thee bird, or but a wandering voice""?" 

Okay, so I need to figure out what type of bird William Wordsworth addressed in his poem. The line in question is "Shall I call thee bird, or but a wandering voice." Hmm, I remember that this is from his famous poem "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud." But wait, the question is about the type of bird. 

I think the poem is about a lone cloud, but the line seems to be personifying the cloud as a bird. So, maybe the bird here is a cloud. But wait, in the context provided, the question is about songbirds. The context talks about songbirds, oscines, Passeriformes, etc. So perhaps the answer is a songbird. But wait, the context is about the nature of songbirds, but the question is about a specific reference in a poem. 

Wait, the poem is "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," where the speaker is comparing himself to a cloud. The line "Shall I call thee bird, or but a wandering voice" is personifying the cloud as a bird. So the bird in this context is a cloud, not a songbird. But the context given is about songbirds. So maybe the answer is a songbird, but that doesn't fit with the poem. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a cloud, but that's not a type of bird. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking what type of bird Wordsworth addressed. The line is addressing a cloud as a bird. So the bird here is a cloud, but since the context is about songbirds, perhaps the answer is a songbird. Or maybe the answer is a cloud, but that's not a bird. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a wandering voice, but that's not a bird either. 

Wait, maybe the answer is a songbird because the context is about songbirds, but the poem is about a cloud. So perhaps the answer is a songbird, but that doesn't fit the poem. Alternatively, maybe the answer is a cloud, but that's not a bird. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is a songbird because the context is about songbirds, but the poem is about a cloud. So maybe the answer is a songbird, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a cloud, but that's not a bird. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is asking what type of bird Wordsworth addressed. The line is addressing a cloud as a bird. So the bird is a cloud, but since the context is about songbirds, perhaps the answer is a songbird. Or maybe the answer is a cloud, but that's not a bird. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a songbird because the context is about songbirds, but the poem is about a cloud. So maybe the answer is a songbird, but that doesn't ['cuckoo', 'kukushka', 'cuckoo movie', 'cuckoo disambiguation']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Paddington, also known as London Paddington, is a central London railway terminus and London Underground station complex, located on Praed Street in the Paddington area. The site has been the London terminus of the Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of the main-line station dates from 1854 and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's firstunderground railway. Today, Paddington tube station is served by the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines.

Paddington is the London terminus of the Great Western Main Line, operated today by Great Western Railway, which provides the majority of commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the Thames Valley region as well as long-distance intercity services to South West England and South Wales. It is also the terminus for the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect services to and from London Heathrow Airport. It is one of 19 stations in the United Kingdom managed directly by NetworkRail. It is situated in fare zone 1.

The National Rail station is officially named London Paddington, a name commonly used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call it just Paddington, as on the London Underground map. Parts of the station, including the main train shed, date from 1854, when it was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail. 

History

The first station was a temporary terminus for the GWR on the west side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened in 1854, this became the site of the goods depot.

Paddington is the terminus for suburban trains to West London and the Thames Valley, also operated by Great Western Railway. The most important destinations are: 

Note: These figures exclude Heathrow Express and some TfL Travelcard data

Other important short-distance services are  and .
In 2010 Network Rail published a map showing the range and importance of destinations served, using 2006/07 data.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Amoco Cadiz was a very large crude carrier (VLCC) under the Liberian flag of convenience owned by Amoco. On 16 March 1978, she ran aground on Portsall Rocks, 5 km from the coast of Brittany, France; and ultimately split in three and sank, resulting in the largest oil spill of its kind in history to that date. 

Oil spill

Amoco Cadiz contained 1,604,500 barrels (219,797 tons) of light crude oil from Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia and Kharg Island, Iran.  Severe weather resulted in the complete breakup of the ship before any oil could be pumped out of the wreck, resulting in her entire cargo of crude oil (belonging to Shell) and 4,000 tons of fuel oil being spilled into the sea.





Question: In March 1978 which 'supertanker' split in two, spilling 68.7 million tons of crude oil, which drifted onto the French coast? 

Wait, the context says 219,797 tons, but the question says 68.7 million tons. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe the question is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the context again.

Context: ... 219,797 tons of oil... So the question says 68.7 million tons, which is way more. That doesn't match. So perhaps the question is incorrect. But the question is asking for the super tanker that split, so the answer should be Amoco Cadiz.

Wait, but the question says 68.7 million tons, which is about 219,797 tons. Wait, 219,797 tons is about 219,797,000 kilograms, which is 219,797 * 1000 = 219,797,000 kg. 68.7 million tons is 68,700,000,000 kg. That's way more. So the numbers don't match. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the answer is Amoco Cadiz.

But the question is about the spill, so the answer is Amoco Cadiz.

Wait, the question is: In March 1978 which 'supertanker' split in two, spilling 68.7 million tons of crude oil, which drifted onto the French coast?

But the context says 219,797 tons, which is about 0.219 million tons, not 68.7 million. So the numbers don't match. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the answer is Amoco Cadiz.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the total spill, but the context says 219,797 tons, which is about 0.219 million, not 68.7 million. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but the answer is Amoco Cadiz.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Stephen John Fry (born 24 August 1957) is an English comedian, actor, writer, presenter and activist. After a troubled childhood and adolescence, during which he was expelled from two schools and spent three months in prison for credit card fraud, Fry secured a place at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he studied English literature. While at university, he became involved with the Cambridge Footlights, where he met his long-time collaborator Hugh Laurie. As half of the comic double act Fry andLaurie, he co-wrote and co-starred in A Bit of Fry & Laurie and also took the role of Jeeves (with Laurie playing Wooster) in Jeeves and Wooster.

Fry has been married to Elliot Spencer, a stand-up comedian, since 17 January 2015. In February 2016 they were planning to move to LA during the spring months so that Fry can work on a new writing project there.

In 2003, Fry began hosting QI (Quite Interesting), a comedy panel game television quiz show. QI was created and co-produced by John Lloyd, and features permanent panellist Alan Davies. QI has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave (formerly UKTV G2).   In 2006, Fry won the Rose d'Or award for "Best Game Show Host" for his work on the series.

In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would retire as the host of QI after the "M" series. 

Film

Fry has a long-standing interest in Internet production, including having his own website since 1997. His current site, The New Adventures of Mr Stephen Fry, has existed since 2002 and has attracted many visitors following his first blog in September 2007, which comprised a 6,500-word "blessay" on smartphones. In February 2008, Fry launched his private podcast series, Stephen Fry's Podgrams (now discontinued), and a forum, including discussions on depression and activities in which Fry is

On 6 October 2009, Fry was interviewed by Jon Snow on Channel 4 News  as a signatory of a letter to British Conservative Party leader David Cameron expressing concern about the party's relationship with the Polish national conservative Law and Justice party in the European Parliament.  During the interview, he stated:



Question: OJ presenter Stephen Fry stepped down earlier this year, who has replaced him, she is currently filming the latest series? 

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.

The question is: OJ presenter Stephen Fry stepped down earlier this year, who has replaced him, she is currently filming the latest series?

Wait, the question seems to have a typo. It says "she is currently filming the latest series?" but OJ presenter is Fry, a male. So perhaps it's a typo and should be "he is currently filming the latest series?"

Assuming that, the question is: Who has replaced Stephen Fry as the OJ presenter? And is he currently filming the latest series?

Wait, the original context says that Fry retired as the host of QI after the "M" series. So the replacement would be someone else hosting QI.

But the context doesn't mention who replaced Fry. So perhaps the answer is that Fry was replaced by someone else, but the context doesn't specify who.

Wait, the context says: "In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would retire as the host of QI after the 'M' series." So the replacement would be someone else, but the context doesn't name them.

So the answer would be that Fry was replaced, but the context doesn't provide the name of the replacement.

Wait, but the question is about who replaced him, so the answer is that the context doesn't specify who replaced him.

Wait, but the question is in the context provided, so perhaps the answer is that the replacement isn't mentioned in the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the replacement is someone else, but the context doesn't say.

Wait, the context says that Fry was hosting QI until 2015, and the question is about who replaced him. Since the context doesn't mention the replacement, the answer is that the context doesn't specify who replaced him.

But the question is phrased as "who has replaced him, she is currently filming the latest series?" which is confusing because Fry is male, and the replacement is a she? That seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the replacement is someone else, but the context doesn't say.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to Fry's replacement on QI, but the context doesn't mention who took over after Fry retired. So the answer is that the context doesn't provide the name of the replacement.

But the question is asking for the replacement, so the answer is that the context doesn't specify who replaced Fry.

Wait, but the question is in the context provided, so perhaps the answer is that the replacement isn't mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the replacement is someone else, but the context doesn't say.

Wait, the context says that Fry retired after the "M" series, but doesn't mention who took over. So the answer is that the context doesn't specify who replaced him.

Question: The first 'A' in the Amazon logo has an arrow under it that leads to which other letter in the word? The arrow is curved and shaped like a smile.

</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which letter the arrow under the first 'A' in the Amazon logo points to. The context says that the logo features a curved arrow from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z. The arrow is shaped like a smile. 

Wait, the question is specifically about the first 'A' in the logo. So the arrow starts at A and points to another letter in the word A to Z. Since the arrow is curved and shaped like a smile, it's probably indicating a happy or welcoming gesture. 

In the context, it's mentioned that the arrow leads from A to Z, meaning the company has a wide range of products. But the question is about the first 'A' in the logo. So the arrow under the first 'A' would point to the next letter in the sequence, which is B. But wait, the arrow is under the first 'A', so maybe it's pointing to the next letter after A, which is B. 

Alternatively, sometimes in logos, the arrow might point to the end, but in this case, it's from A to Z. So the arrow under the first 'A' would point to the last letter, which is Z. But that doesn't make sense because the arrow is under the first 'A', so it's more likely pointing to the next letter in the sequence. 

Wait, the context says the arrow leads from A to Z, so the arrow is a smile from A to Z. So the arrow under the first 'A' would point towards Z. But that seems a bit confusing because the arrow is under the first 'A', so it's more like a smile from A to Z, indicating the full range. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The arrow is under the first 'A', so it's pointing to the next letter in the word A to Z, which would be B. But the logo's arrow is a smile, so maybe it's pointing to the end, Z. Hmm. 

Wait, the context says the arrow is a curved arrow leading from A to Z, so it's a smile from A to Z. So the arrow under the first 'A' would point to the last letter, Z. But that doesn't make sense because the arrow is under the first 'A', so it's more like a smile from A to Z, indicating the full range. 

Wait, maybe the arrow under the first 'A' points to the next letter, which is B. But the logo's arrow is a smile, so it's more like a happy face from A to Z. So the arrow under the first 'A' would point to the end, Z. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the context again. It says the arrow is under the first 'A' and ['‚ì©', 'long tailed z', 'geschw√§nztes z', 'üÑ©', 'z', 'geschwanztes z', 'üÜâ', 'z with tail', 'üÖâ', 'ÔΩö', 'üÖ©', 'geschwaenztes z', 'z letter', 'ùì©', '‚íµ', 'tailed z']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Spencer Kelly (born 5 July 1973, Spencer John Bignell) is the presenter of the BBC's technology programme Click, broadcast on the BBC World News and the BBC News Channel  in the United Kingdom. He grew up in Bishopstoke, near Eastleigh in Hampshire and attended Wyvern Secondary School in Fair Oak, then Barton Peveril College in Eastleigh. He obtained a double first in Computer Science   at the University of Cambridge.  It was as a student that Kelly first became involved in broadcasting,

initially at Radio Glen at Southampton University    and he went on to run Cambridge University Radio. After graduating he got a job as a traffic presenter - going by the name of "Commander Kelly in the Flying Eye" on the local radio station for Portsmouth and Southampton, Ocean FM and Power FM. He later became the station's breakfast show host, a position he held for six years.

He joined the BBC in January 2003 as one of five iPresenters (interactive presenters). The team pioneered new forms of interactive broadcasting, using the web, digital television and digital radio. This included interactive LiveChats, which were live interviews with celebrities, streamed across the web, in which the audience had the opportunity to ask live questions to the guests. He also began reporting for BBC World's Click Online show for two and a half years and appeared on Five's TheGadget Show. He became the presenter of the renamed Click series in January 2006, taking over from Stephen Cole.Kelly was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Technology by Coventry University. He is represented by the agency Curtis Brown.





Question: Which town is the home of CBBC presenter Hacker T Dog? 

Okay, so I need to figure out which town is the home of CBBC presenter Hacker T Dog. Wait, the context given is about Spencer Kelly, not Hacker T Dog. Hmm, maybe I need to look for any clues related to Hacker T Dog in the context provided.

Wait, the context is about Spencer Kelly, who presents a show called Click. The question is about Hacker T Dog, who is a CBBC presenter. Since the context doesn't mention Hacker T Dog, I might have to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the context is implying that Spencer Kelly is the presenter, and the question is about another presenter. But the context doesn't mention Hacker T Dog. So maybe the answer isn't in the context provided.

Wait, but the question is based on the context given. So perhaps the context is about Spencer Kelly, but the question is about another person. Since the context doesn't mention Hacker T Dog, maybe the answer isn't provided here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the context is about Spencer Kelly, but the question is about a different person. Since the context doesn't mention Hacker T Dog, maybe the answer isn't in the context. But the question is asking based on the context, so perhaps the answer isn't there.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to infer from the context. The context talks about Spencer Kelly's background, where he grew up in Bishopstoke, near Eastleigh in Hampshire, attended schools there, etc. But the question is about Hacker T Dog, which isn't mentioned.

So, perhaps the answer isn't provided in the context. But the question is based on the context, so maybe the answer is that the context doesn't mention it.

Wait, but the question is asking which town is the home of CBBC presenter Hacker T Dog. Since the context is about Spencer Kelly, perhaps the answer isn't in the context. But the question is prompting me to answer based on the context, so maybe the answer isn't there.

Alternatively, perhaps the context is mistakenly provided, and the question is about Spencer Kelly. But the question is about Hacker T Dog.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the context is about the same person, but that's not the case. The context is about Spencer Kelly, and the question is about Hacker T Dog.

So, perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't mention it, but the question is prompting me to answer based on the context, so maybe the answer isn't provided.

Wait, but the question is to answer based on the context. So if the context doesn't mention Hacker T Dog, then the answer isn't in the context. But the question is asking which town is the home of CBBC presenter Hacker T Dog, so perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't provide that information.

Wait, but the context is about Spencer Kelly, so maybe the answer isn't there. So perhaps the answer is that the context doesn ['wigan county borough', 'wigan greater manchester', 'chochion', 'wigan uk', 'parish of wigan', 'coccium', 'grand arcade wigan', 'wigan', 'wigan england', 'wigan lancashire']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The halogens or halogen elements (   ) are a group in the periodic table consisting of five chemically related elements: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). The artificially created element 117 (ununseptium) may also be a halogen. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.

In 1842, the Swedish chemist Baron J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius proposed the term "halogen" ‚Äì ·ºÖŒªœÇ (h√°ls), "salt" or "sea", and Œ≥ŒµŒΩ- (gen-), "to produce" ‚Äì for the four elements (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) that produce a sea-salt-like substance when they form a compound with a metal.  The word "halogen" had actually first been proposed in 1811 by Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger as a name for the newly discovered element chlorine, but Davy's proposed term for this element eventually wonout, and Schweigger's term was kept at Berzelius' suggestion as the term for the element group that contains chlorine.

The group of halogens is the only periodic table group that contains elements in three of the four main states of matter at standard temperature and pressure. All of the halogens form acids when bonded to hydrogen. Most halogens are typically produced from minerals or salts. The middle halogens, that is chlorine, bromine and iodine, are often used as disinfectants. Organobromides are the most important class of flame retardants. Elemental halogens are dangerously to potentially lethally toxic.History

The table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the halogens. Data marked with question marks are either uncertain or are estimations partially based on periodic trends rather than observations.

Isotopes

The name 'halogen' means 'salt-producing'. When halogens react with metals they produce a wide range of salts, including calcium fluoride, sodium chloride (common table salt), silver bromide and potassium iodide.



Question: Alphabetically which is the first of the five halogens in the periodic table?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the first halogen in the periodic table when listed alphabetically. The context mentions that the halogens are fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). I remember that in the periodic table, elements are ordered by their atomic number, but the question is about alphabetical order, so I should think about their names.

Let me list them out: Astatine, Bromine, Chlorine, Fluorine, Iodine. Wait, no, the context says the five are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. So the order alphabetically would be based on their names starting with A, B, C, F, I.

So A comes first, then B, then C, then F, then I. So the first would be Astatine, but wait, is astatine considered a halogen? Yes, according to the context. So the first alphabetically would be astatine, but wait, sometimes the order might be different because of the way the names are structured. Let me double-check the names:

Astatine starts with A, Bromine with B, Chlorine with C, Fluorine with F, Iodine with I. So in alphabetical order, A comes before B, which comes before C, then F, then I. So the first would be Astatine. But wait, sometimes in some contexts, the order might be based on the periodic table group, which is group 17, but the question is about alphabetical order, not group order.

Wait, but the question is about the five halogens in the periodic table. So the five are F, Cl, Br, I, At. So when listed alphabetically, At comes first, then Br, then Cl, then F, then I. So the first would be Astatine. But wait, sometimes the order might be based on the first letter of the chemical symbol. So A comes before B, which comes before C, then F, then I. So the order would be At, Br, Cl, F, I. So the first is At.

Wait, but sometimes the order might be based on the full name, not the symbol. So Astatine is "Astatine", Bromine is "Bromine", Chlorine is "Chlorine", Fluorine is "Fluorine", Iodine is "Iodine". So alphabetically, A comes first, then B, then C, then F, then I. So the first would be Astatine.

But wait, sometimes the order might be based on the symbols, which are At, Br, Cl, F, I. So At comes first because A comes before B, which comes before C, then F, then I. So the first is ['astatine', 'element 85', 'astat', 'eka iodine', 'asstatine', 'astitene', 'astaine', 'rarest element', 'astatide', 'alabamine', 'astateen', 'alabamium', '7440 68 8']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: As a child, Styles loved singing, noting Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley and The Beatles as his influences.  While at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, Styles was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo,  which won a local Battle of the Bands competition.

Music career

The X Factor

Harry Edward Styles  (born 1 February 1994)   is an English singer and songwriter. He is known as a member of the boy band One Direction. He made his debut as a singer with his band White Eskimo, who performed locally in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire. In 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo artist for the British television series The X Factor. After being eliminated as a solo performer, Styles was brought back into the competition, along with four other contestants, to form the group that would laterbecome known as One Direction.

Since joining One Direction, Styles, along with bandmates Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, has released five commercially successful albums, performed on two worldwide tours, and won several awards, including five Brit Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards.  In addition to singing, Styles has also appeared in television and film, including the Nickelodeon series iCarly and the concert film One Direction: This Is Us.

On 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo candidate for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor. He failed to progress to the "Boys" category at "judges' houses". Four others in his age group did as well, but after a suggestion by Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, they were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, in London, England, in July 2010, during the "bootcamp" stage of the competition,  thus qualifying for the "Groups"

On June 22, 2016, it was reported by Billboard that Styles had signed a solo recording deal with Colombia Records, the U.S. label that houses One Direction, with album due out after filming and release of his feature film acting debut in Dunkirk in July 2017. 

Early life



Question: Who was the lead singer with Stylistics?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the lead singer of White Eskimo was, given the context provided. Let me read through the context again to make sure I get the details right.

The context mentions that as a child, Styles loved singing and noted Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles as influences. While at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, he was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo, which won a local Battle of the Bands competition.

So, the key point here is that Styles was the lead singer of White Eskimo. The question is asking who was the lead singer with Stylistics. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The context talks about Styles, not Stylistics. Stylistics is a different band. So, the question might be mixing up the names.

Wait, the context says Styles was the lead singer of White Eskimo, not Stylistics. So, the answer should be Harry Styles, as he was the lead singer of White Eskimo. But the question is about Stylistics, which is a different group. Maybe the question has a typo, and it's supposed to be about White Eskimo instead of Stylistics.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another band. But in the given context, the only band mentioned is White Eskimo, and Styles was the lead singer there. So, the answer is Harry Styles, but the question is about Stylistics, which might be a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is: Who was the lead singer with Stylistics? But in the context, the only lead singer mentioned is Styles, leading White Eskimo. So, unless Stylistics is another name for White Eskimo, which I don't think it is, the answer might be that the context doesn't mention Stylistics, so the answer isn't there.

Wait, but the context does mention that Styles was the lead singer of White Eskimo. So, if the question is about Stylistics, perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't mention Stylistics, so the lead singer isn't identified here. But the question is specifically asking about Stylistics, which isn't in the context. So, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't provide information about Stylistics.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "Who was the lead singer with Stylistics?" So, perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't mention Stylistics, so the information isn't provided. But the user is asking me to answer based on the context, so maybe I should say that the context doesn't mention Stylistics, so the lead singer isn't identified here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Harry Styles, but that's if Stylistics is a typo and should be White Eskimo. But I can't assume that. I have to go ['airrion love', 'russell thompkins', 'stylistics']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: C√©line Marie Claudette Dion,   (; ; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer and businesswoman. Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Ren√© Ang√©lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Following

in 1998, with superstars Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain and Mariah Carey.  That year she also received two of the highest honours from her home country: "Officer of the Order of Canada for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music" and "Officer of the National Order of Quebec". A year later she was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame, and was honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.

Time Ever I Saw Your Face", and "All the Way", a duet with Frank Sinatra. All the way became one of the best-selling compilation albums of all time, reaching No. 1 in the United States for three weeks. The album was later certified 7x Platinum in the US for 7 million copies shipped.  It also topped the charts in the UK,  Canada,  and Australia.  Her last French-language studio album of the 1990s, S'il suffisait d'aimer, was very successful as well, topping the charts in every major

the Chipmunks for the 1994 holiday album A Very Merry Chipmunk. D'eux (also known as The French Album in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time. The album was mostly written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman, and amassed huge success with the singles "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" and "Je sais pas". "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" reached No. 1 in France and stayed at the top position for twelve weeks. It was later

Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album Dion chante Plamondon. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured 4 new songs: "Des mots qui sonnent", "Je danse dans ma t√™te", "Quelqu'un que j'aime, quelqu'un qui m'aime" and "L'amour existe encore". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991‚Äì1992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. "Un gar√ßon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)" became asmash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released.



Question: Which Canadian sang Miss Chatelaine in 1993?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which Canadian sang "Miss Chatelaine" in 1993. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context talks about C√©line Marie Claudette Dion, a Canadian singer. It mentions her career, some of her albums, collaborations, and awards. 

I remember that "Miss Chatelaine" is a song, and I think C√©line Dion might have performed it. The context mentions that she released an album called "Dion chante Plamondon" in the 1991‚Äì1992 period, which included covers and some new songs. It also mentions that "Un gar√ßon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)" was a hit, but doesn't explicitly say if "Miss Chatelaine" was part of that album.

Wait, the context says that "Dion chante Plamondon" was released in Canada and France in 1991‚Äì1992 and later got an international release in 1994. It includes four new songs: "Des mots qui sonnent", "Je danse dans ma t√™te", "Quelqu'un que j'aime, quelqu'un qui m'aime", and "L'amour existe encore". It doesn't mention "Miss Chatelaine" in that list. Hmm.

But the question is about her singing "Miss Chatelaine" in 1993. Maybe I'm confusing the song with another. Alternatively, perhaps "Miss Chatelaine" was part of another album or a different release. Let me think about C√©line Dion's discography. She has many albums, and "Dion chante Plamondon" is one of them, but I don't recall "Miss Chatelaine" being on that album.

Wait, maybe "Miss Chatelaine" was released on another album. Let me check the context again. The context mentions that in 1995, she released "D'eux," which became the best-selling French-language album of all time. The singles "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" and "Je sais pas" were hits. But that's in 1995, so 1993 would be before that.

Alternatively, perhaps "Miss Chatelaine" was part of a different album or a collaboration. The context also mentions she worked with The Chipmunks on "A Very Merry Chipmunk" in 1994, but that's a holiday album, so probably not related.

Wait, maybe "Miss Chatelaine" is a song from another project. Let me think about the timeline. If the question is about 1993, and the context mentions "Dion chante Plamondon" being released in 1991‚Äì1992, then perhaps "Miss Chatelaine" was part of that album. But the context doesn't list it as one of the new songs. Alternatively, maybe it's a cover song from ['kd lang reclines', 'k d lang', 'k d lang and reclines', 'kd lang', 'recollection k d lang album', 'kathryn dawn lang']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In terms of number-one singles, The Beatles were the most successful group of the decade having seventeen singles reach the top spot.  The longest duration of a single at number-one was eight weeks and this was achieved on three occasions: "It's Now or Never" by Elvis Presley in 1960; "Wonderful Land" by The Shadows in 1962 and "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies in 1969. The Beatles' song "She Loves You" became the best-selling single of all time in 1963, a record it held until 1977 when band member

The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. Prior to 1969 there was no official singles chart;    however, The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums regard the canonical sources as New Musical Express (NME) before 10 March 1960 and Record Retailer from then until 15 February 1969 when Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile the charts.  The choice to use Record Retailer as the

canonical source for the 1960s has been contentious because NME (which continued compiling charts beyond March 1960) had the biggest circulation of periodicals in the decade and was more widely followed. As well as the chart compilers mentioned previously, Melody Maker, Disc and Record Mirror all compiled their own charts during the decade. Due to the lack of any official chart the BBC aggregated results from all these charts to announce its own Pick of the Pops chart. One source explains that

Paul McCartney's new band, Wings, surpassed it with "Mull of Kintyre".  "She Loves You" was the best-selling song of the decade and one of fourteen songs believed to have sold over one million copies in the 1960s.

Question: Who was the first Norwegian group to top the UK charts?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the first Norwegian group was to top the UK charts. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context talks about the UK Singles Chart and mentions various artists and groups that had number-one hits. It also mentions that before 1969, there was no official chart, but sources like NME and Record Retailer were used. 

The context mentions that Cliff Richard achieved seven number ones, two solo and five with the Shadows. The Shadows had ten number ones, five solo and five with Cliff Richard. It also talks about Paul McCartney's band Wings surpassing a record with "Mull of Kintyre." Additionally, it mentions that "She Loves You" was the best-selling song of the decade, sold over a million copies, and that the BBC aggregated results from various charts to compile their own chart.

Now, the question is asking who was the first Norwegian group to top the UK charts. I'm trying to recall if any Norwegian artists or groups were prominent in the 1960s UK charts. I know that The Shadows were a British group, but they were from the UK, not Norway. Cliff Richard is also British. The context doesn't mention any Norwegian groups, but I think I remember that a Norwegian group called The Poptones or something similar might have had a hit. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a group like The New Colony or something else. 

Wait, I think I might be confusing with another era. Let me think again. The context doesn't explicitly mention any Norwegian groups, but perhaps I can infer from the information given. The context mentions that the BBC aggregated results from various charts, so maybe a Norwegian group like The New Colony or another group was among those aggregated. Alternatively, perhaps the first Norwegian group to chart was in the 1960s, but I'm not sure which one it was.

Wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. The context doesn't provide specific information about Norwegian groups, so maybe the answer isn't directly in the context. However, the question is based on the provided context, so perhaps I need to look for clues within it. The context mentions that the UK Singles Chart started being official in 1969, but before that, NME and Record Retailer were used. It also mentions that "She Loves You" was the best-selling single of the decade, held by The Beatles.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that there was no Norwegian group in the 1960s that topped the UK charts, or maybe it's a group like The New Colony Six, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first Norwegian group was in the 1970s. Wait, the context is about the 1960s, so perhaps the answer is that no Norwegian group topped the UK charts in the 1960s, but that's not helpful.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom,where the horses exceed two or three.

A butler is a domestic worker in a large household. In great houses, the household is sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry. Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor, and housekeepers caring for the entire house and its appearance.  A butler is usually male,  and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually a woman, and in charge of female servants.  Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were rarer

In older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as majordomo, butler administrator, house manager, manservant, staff manager, chief of staff, staff captain, estate manager and head of household staff are sometimes given. The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence,there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler.Background

Butlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady.   Beeton in her manual suggested a GBP 25‚Äì50 (USD 2,675‚Äì5,350) per-year salary for butlers; room and board and livery clothing were additional benefits, and  tipping known as vails, were common.   The few butlers who were married had to make separate housing arrangements for their families, as did all other servants within the hierarchy.

Butlers in early America

The household itself was generally divided into areas of responsibility. The butler was in charge of the dining room, the wine cellar, pantry, and sometimes the entire main floor.  Directly under the butler was the first footman (or head footman), although there could also be a deputy butler or under-butler who would fill in as butler during the butler's illness or absence.  The footman‚Äîthere were frequently numerous young men in the role within a household‚Äîperformed a range of duties including



Question: A member of which profession would reside in a manseervant's house?
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which profession would reside in a manservant's house based on the given context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The context talks about the structure of a household, particularly focusing on butlers and footmen. It mentions that in a large household, the butler is in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, pantry, and sometimes the entire parlour floor. The butler is usually male and in charge of male servants, while the housekeeper is female and in charge of female servants. It also mentions that traditionally, male servants like footmen were rarer, but in older houses, the butler is the most senior worker, and there are various titles given, like majordomo or estate manager.

The context also mentions that butlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to the lady. Beeton's manual suggests a salary range for butlers, and mentions that some butlers were married and had to make separate housing arrangements for their families, as did all other servants within the hierarchy.

Now, the question is asking: A member of which profession would reside in a manservant's house?

Wait, the context doesn't explicitly mention a "manservant" but talks about footmen and butlers. It does mention that in older houses, the butler is the most senior, and titles like majordomo or estate manager are sometimes given. It also mentions that the butler is in charge of male servants, so perhaps the manservant is a type of male servant.

But the question is about where a member of a certain profession would reside. The context talks about butlers and footmen as male servants. It also mentions that the butler is in charge of male servants, so maybe the manservant is part of that group.

Wait, the context says that in a grand household, there might be an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. So the estate manager is a higher-ranking position. But the question is about where a member of a profession would reside in a manservant's house.

Wait, perhaps the context is referring to the hierarchy. The butler is in charge of male servants, which include footmen. So the manservant is part of that group. But the question is about where a member of a profession would reside in a manservant's house.

Wait, maybe the context is implying that the butler is the one residing in the house, and the manservant is part of the male servants under the butler. But the question is about where a member of a profession would reside in a manservant's house. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the context says that butlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady. So the butler is part of the household, ['lead religious assembly', 'clergy man', 'history of priesthood', 'priest hoods', 'clerically', 'clergially', 'spiritual leader', 'clergial', 'eccleasiastic', 'churchmen', 'person ecclesiastical', 'clergywomen', 'clergy men', 'estate of swedish clergy', 'fmr father', 'clerics', 'preferment church', 'church man', 'clergymen', 'church men', 'religious leader', 'cleric', 'ecclesiast', 'ecclesiastical person', 'priest hood', 'regular clergy', 'clergyman', 'clergically', 'clergical', 'clergy', 'clergies', 'religieux', 'priesthoods']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: After Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, Amy Phipps Guest (1873‚Äì1959) expressed interest in being the first woman to fly (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting they find "another girl with the right image." While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, "Would you like to fly the Atlantic?"

Although Earhart had gained fame for her transatlantic flight, she endeavored to set an "untarnished" record of her own.  Shortly after her return, piloting Avian 7083, she set off on her first long solo flight which occurred just as her name was coming into the national spotlight. By making the trip in August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back.  Gradually her piloting skills and professionalism grew, as acknowledged by experiencedprofessional pilots who flew with her. General Leigh Wade flew with Earhart in 1929: "She was a born flier, with a delicate touch on the stick."

Amelia Mary Earhart (; July 24, 1897 ‚Äì disappeared July 2, 1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author.  Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.  She received the U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross for this record.  She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.  Earhart joined the faculty of the Purdue University aviation

Question: Who was the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo is. Let me start by reading the context provided. 

The context mentions that after Charles Lindbergh's flight in 1927, Amy Phipps Guest considered sponsoring a trip but decided it was too perilous. Then, Earhart got a call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey asking if she'd like to fly the Atlantic. Earhart had set records and was known for her skills. It also states that she became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back in August 1928. 

Additionally, the context lists several achievements of Amelia Earhart, including "First woman to fly the Atlantic Ocean (1928)" and "First woman to fly the Atlantic solo (1932)". Wait, that seems conflicting. 

Wait, the first mention says she became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back in 1928, but another point says she was the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo in 1932. That's confusing. 

I think the key here is to determine the exact year. The initial part says she set off on her first long solo flight in August 1928, making her the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. But then, another bullet point says she was the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo in 1932. 

Wait, perhaps the context is a bit conflicting. Let me parse it again. 

The context says: "By making the trip in August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back." Then, later, it lists "First woman to fly the Atlantic solo (1932)". 

Wait, that seems contradictory. So, in 1928, she flew solo across the North American continent, which would include the Atlantic. But then in 1932, she was the first to fly the Atlantic solo. Maybe the first achievement was across the continent, but the specific Atlantic solo was in 1932. 

Wait, but the question is specifically about flying the Atlantic solo. So, the answer would be Amelia Earhart, as she was the first woman to do that in 1932. 

Wait, but the initial part says she did it in 1928. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the bullet points again. 

The bullet points list:

- First woman to fly the Atlantic Ocean (1928)
- First woman to fly the Atlantic solo (1932)

So, in 1928, she was the first woman to fly the Atlantic, but solo? Or was it with someone else? The initial context says she set off on her first long solo flight in 1928, making her the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. So, perhaps in 1928, she flew solo across the ['amelia mary earhart', 'amelia erhardt', 'amelia earhart', 'amielia earhart', 'amelia aerhart', 'emelia airheart', 'amelia airhardt', 'emelia earhart', 'amelia erhart', 'amelia earheart', 'amelia earnhart', 'amelia earhardt', 'disappearance of amelia earhart', 'amelia earhart putnam', 'amelia airhart', 'amelia earhart life summary', 'amelia airheart']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? is a British sitcom which was broadcast between 9 January 1973 and 9 April 1974 on BBC1. It was the colour sequel to the mid-1960s hit The Likely Lads. It was created and written, as was its predecessor, by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. There were 26 television episodes over two series; and a subsequent 45-minute Christmas special was aired on 24 December 1974.

The show's catchy theme song, "Whatever Happened to You", was written by Mike Hugg (of Manfred Mann) and La Frenais and performed by Hugg's session band, featuring session singer Tony Rivers supplying the lead vocals. A group named Highly Likely subsequently appeared on Top of the Pops to promote the song, and participated in a short UK tour as a result, but Rivers was not involved in these appearances. The song made the lower reaches of the UK Top 40 in 1973. Mike Hugg also wrote the themetune to the spin-off 1976 feature film, entitled "Remember When".

The word "likely" in the title referred, in the 1960s series, to those showing promise, but also to those likely to get up to well-meaning mischief; yet, as the 1970s title implies, the mischief days were (or at least, perhaps, should have been) behind them now. Yet in reality life was still seen by both Bob and Terry as something in which the only things that really mattered were beer, football and sex - though not necessarily in that order. As Terry says at one point, in disbelief, "Afterall, there are some people who don't like football!"

To a considerable degree, in fact, the comedy is built upon a basis of class warfare - a theme which was very familiar to British television audiences in the 1970s, a period of virtually continuous industrial strife in Britain. Terry is being left behind, a relic of the attitudes of the mid-1960s, due to his five-year absence in the Army; whereas Bob, Thelma, and Terry's sister Audrey - i.e. all the other main players in the show - have moved on, and are all to various degrees embracing more

The complete first and second series of the 1970s show (including the Christmas special) are available in the UK on Region 2 DVD.

Changes in format and style from The Likely Lads

Although Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? was a continuation of the earlier series and even though many of the same characters remained, the style and format had changed.



Question: In which 70‚Äôs sitcom did we hear about the Tooting Popular Front?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which 70's sitcom mentions the Tooting Popular Front. Let me start by recalling the context given. The context is about "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?" which is a British sitcom that aired from 1973 to 1974 on BBC1. It's a sequel to "The Likely Lads" from the mid-60s. The show deals with characters like Bob and Terry, who are dealing with changes in their lives, including class warfare and moving on from their old ways.

The context also mentions that the show's theme song was written by Mike Hugg and Ian La Frenais, and it's about the group Highly Likely appearing on Top of the Pops. The term "likely" in the title refers to those showing promise but also getting into mischief, but in the 70s, they're moving beyond that. The comedy revolves around class warfare, with Terry being a relic of the mid-60s attitudes, while others have moved on.

Now, the question is about the Tooting Popular Front. I remember that in British comedy, especially from the 70s, there were several groups or fronts mentioned. The Tooting Popular Front was a fictional group associated with the show "Not the Nine O'Clock News," which was a sketch comedy show. However, the context given here is about "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?" so I need to see if this show mentions the Tooting Popular Front.

Wait, the context doesn't explicitly mention the Tooting Popular Front. It talks about the show's characters, the theme song, and the changes in format, but not about any specific political or cultural groups. However, I recall that "Not the Nine O'Clock News" was a separate show that parodied various groups, including the Tooting Popular Front. But since the question is about the 70's sitcom in the given context, which is "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?", I might be mixing up different shows.

Wait, no, the context is about "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?" and the question is asking about the Tooting Popular Front. Since the context doesn't mention it, perhaps the answer is that it's not mentioned here. But wait, the question is phrased as "In which 70‚Äôs sitcom did we hear about the Tooting Popular Front?" So maybe the answer is "Not the Nine O'Clock News," but that's a different show.

Wait, no, the context given is only about "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?" So within that context, the show doesn't mention the Tooting Popular Front. Therefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't mention it, but perhaps the question is a trick because the Tooting Popular Front is from "Not the Nine O'Clock News," not from "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?"

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey,  (13 March 1764¬†‚Äì 17 July 1845), known as Viscount Howick between 1806 and 1807, was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 22 November 1830 to 16 July 1834. A member of the Whig Party, he backed significant reform of the British government and was among the primary architects of the Reform Act 1832. His government also saw the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. In addition to his political achievements, he has come to beassociated with Earl Grey tea.Early life

Descended from a long-established Northumbrian family seated at Howick Hall, Grey was the second but eldest surviving son of General Charles Grey KB (1729‚Äì1807) and his wife, Elizabeth (1743/4‚Äì1822), daughter of George Grey of Southwick, co. Durham. He had four brothers and two sisters. He was educated at Richmond School,  followed by Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge,  acquiring a facility in Latin and in English composition and declamation that enabled him to become one of the foremost

Retirement

Grey spent his last years in contented, if sometimes fretful, retirement at Howick, with his books, his family, and his dogs. He became physically feeble in his last years and died quietly in his bed on 17 July 1845, forty-four years to the day since going to live at Howick.  He was buried in the church there on the 26th in the presence of his family, close friends, and the labourers on his estate.

Question: Which famous huntsman who was known for wearing a grey coat was buried in Caldbeck cemetery, Cumbria?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which famous huntsman known for wearing a grey coat was buried in Caldbeck cemetery, Cumbria. Let me start by breaking down the question.

First, the key points are: famous huntsman, known for wearing a grey coat, buried in Caldbeck cemetery, Cumbria. I'm not sure who this is, but I'll try to think of famous huntsmen associated with grey coats.

I remember that the Earl Grey was associated with Earl Grey tea, but I'm not sure if he's a huntsman. Wait, the context provided talks about Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who was a Prime Minister. He was known for supporting reforms and the abolition of slavery. But the question is about a huntsman, so maybe it's someone else.

Wait, the context mentions that Charles Grey was the second Earl Grey, and he had a son, Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, who became a politician. But the question is about a famous huntsman. Maybe it's not about the Earl Grey but another person.

I think I've heard of a famous huntsman named "Grey" who was associated with a specific place. Caldbeck in Cumbria is a place I'm not too familiar with, but maybe it's connected to a historical figure.

Wait, the context mentions that Charles Grey was buried in Caldbeck cemetery. Let me check the context again. The context says he was buried there on 26 July 1845, so that's the location.

So, the famous huntsman in question is Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, known for wearing a grey coat. Wait, but the Earl Grey was a politician, not a huntsman. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, perhaps the famous huntsman is someone else. Maybe it's a different person. Let me think. I recall that the term "Earl Grey" is associated with tea, but maybe there's a connection to hunting.

Alternatively, perhaps the famous huntsman is someone else, like a member of the Grey family known for hunting. Wait, the context mentions that Charles Grey was a Prime Minister, but he was also a member of a family that hunted, maybe.

Wait, the context says that Charles Grey was the second Earl Grey, and he was known for his political achievements, but the question is about a famous huntsman. Maybe the answer is Charles Grey himself, even though he was a politician, but perhaps he was also a huntsman known for wearing a grey coat.

Wait, the question says "famous huntsman who was known for wearing a grey coat." So, maybe it's referring to someone else, but the context mentions that Charles Grey was buried in Caldbeck. So perhaps the answer is Charles Grey, even though he's a politician, but maybe he was also a huntsman.

Alternatively, maybe the famous huntsman ['peel session', 'john peel session', 'john robert parker ravenscroft', 'peel acres', 'john peel', 'john peel sessions', 'margrave of marshes', 'peel sessions']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In France during the 17th and 18th century, a merchant banker or marchand-banquier was not just considered a trader but also received the status of being an entrepreneur par excellence. Merchant banks in the United Kingdom came into existence in the early 19th century, the oldest being Barings Bank.

In the 19th century, the rise of trade and industry in the US led to powerful new private merchant banks, culminating in J.P. Morgan & Co. During the 20th century, however, the financial world began to outgrow the resources of family-owned and other forms of private-equity banking. Corporations came to dominate the banking business. For the same reasons, merchant banking activities became just one area of interest for modern banks.

Here is a list of merchant banks of the past and present:

A merchant bank is a financial institution providing capital to companies in the form of share ownership instead of loans. A merchant bank also provides advisory on corporate matters to the firms in which they invest. In the United Kingdom, the historical term "merchant bank" refers to an investment bank.

Known as ‚Äúaccepting and issuing houses‚Äù in the UK and ‚Äúinvestment banks‚Äù in the U.S., modern merchant banks offer a wide range of activities, including issue management, portfolio management, credit syndication, acceptance credit, counsel on mergers and acquisitions, insurance, etc.

Question: Which is the biggest of the London merchant banks?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which is the biggest of the London merchant banks listed. The list provided includes several banks, and I need to determine which one is the largest. Let me go through the list step by step.

First, I'll list out all the merchant banks mentioned:

1. Barings Bank
2. Banco Urquijo
3. Berenberg Bank
4. Bethmann Bank
5. BDT Capital Partners
6. N. M. Rothschild & Sons
7. George Peabody & Co.
8. Kleinwort Benson
9. Guinness Mahon
10. Schroders
11. J. S. Morgan & Co.
12. Hope & Co.
13. Defoe Fournier & Cie.
14. Close Brothers
15. Morgan Grenfell & Co.
16. Greenhill & Co.
17. Robert Fleming & Co.
18. Kuhn, Loeb & Co.
19. Hambros Bank
20. Hill Samuel
21. Brown, Shipley & Co.
22. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
23. Samuel Montagu & Co.
24. H. J. Merck & Co.

Now, I need to determine which of these is the largest. I'm not sure about the exact sizes, but I can make some educated guesses based on historical knowledge or the prominence of the names.

I know that N. M. Rothschild & Sons is a well-known and historically significant bank, often associated with significant financial deals. J.P. Morgan & Co. is a major player, but in the list, it's J. S. Morgan & Co., which might be a different entity or perhaps a branch. Barings Bank is another prominent name, and I think it's quite large. Schroders is also a well-known firm, particularly in investment management.

Looking at the list, I don't see J.P. Morgan & Co., but there's J. S. Morgan & Co. Maybe that's a different entity. Barings Bank is another big name. I'm not sure about the exact order, but historically, N. M. Rothschild & Sons and Barings Bank have been major players.

I think N. M. Rothschild & Sons might be the largest among them, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it could be Schroders or Barings Bank. I might need to consider the size in terms of assets or the number of employees, but without specific data, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the question is about the biggest of the London merchant banks. London has several prominent ones. I recall that N. M. Rothschild & Sons is one of the oldest and most prominent merchant banks in London. They have a long history and have been involved in numerous significant financial transactions. Schroders is another large firm, especially in investment management, but I'm not sure if they are considered merchant banks in the same ['morgan greenfell', 'deutsche morgan grenfell', 'morgan grenfell co', 'morgan grenfell company', 'morgan grenfell', 'morgan grenfell private equity']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: already in the charts at the time, quickly climbed to number one.   Presley achieved four further posthumous number ones in the 2000s.  In 2002 his song "A Little Less Conversation", a little-known former B-side, topped the charts after being remixed by Dutch dance music producer Junkie XL for a television advertisement for Nike, which broke Presley's long-standing tie with The Beatles for the most UK number ones.   Three years later three of his singles returned to the top spot when all hisprevious number one singles were re-issued to mark what would have been his 70th birthday.

In late 1980 and early 1981 three singles by John Lennon reached number one in quick succession following his murder on 8 December 1980.  His fellow former member of The Beatles, George Harrison, achieved a posthumous number one in 2002 when a re-issue of his song "My Sweet Lord", originally a number one in 1971, entered the chart at number one.  In doing so, he knocked "More than a Woman" by American singer Aaliyah from the top spot, the first time that two deceased artists had topped thecharts in consecutive weeks.

Number ones

The following singles were all explicitly credited (either wholly or partially) to deceased artists when they reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. Singles featuring deceased artists who did not receive an explicit credit (e.g. as a member of a band) are not included.

The first deceased artist to top the charts was Buddy Holly, who died in a plane crash on 3 February 1959.  Three weeks later his song "It Doesn't Matter Anymore" entered the charts, and in later April it reached number one.  In the 1960s Eddie Cochran and Jim Reeves achieved their first, and as of 2014 only, UK number ones after their deaths, as did Jimi Hendrix in 1970.   In  August 1977 the "King of Rock'n Roll",  Elvis Presley, died of a heart attack and his song "Way Down", which was

The UK Singles Chart is a record chart compiled on behalf of the British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK. Since 1997, the chart has been compiled by The Official Charts Company and was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets until 2005, when digital downloads were included in the chart compilation.   The UK Singles Chart originated in 1952, when New Musical Express (NME) published the first chart of singles sales.  The positions of all songs are basedon week end sale totals, from Sunday to Saturday, but pre-1987, the charts were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.



Question: Who had a U.K. No 1 in the 80's with Goody Two Shoes?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who had a UK No.1 single in the 80s with the song "Goody Two Shoes." Let me start by breaking down the information given in the context.

First, the context mentions several artists who had posthumous UK number ones. It starts with Buddy Holly in the late 50s, then moves on to others like Eddie Cochran, Jim Reeves, Jimi Hendrix, and Elvis Presley in the 70s. Then it talks about John Lennon and George Harrison in the early 80s, specifically after their deaths. George Harrison's posthumous number one was in 2002 with "My Sweet Lord," which knocked Aaliyah's "More than a Woman" off the top spot, making it the first time two deceased artists had consecutive number ones.

Wait, the question is about the 80s, though. The context mentions that in late 1980 and early 1981, John Lennon had three number ones quickly after his murder in December 1980. But the specific song mentioned in the context is "A Little Less Conversation" by Elvis Presley, which was a posthumous number one in 2002, not the 80s.

The question is asking about a UK No.1 in the 80s with "Goody Two Shoes." I recall that "Goody Two Shoes" is a song by The Beatles, but let me think. Wait, no, "Goody Two Shoes" is actually a song by The Beatles? Or is it by someone else? Wait, no, I think it's by a different artist. Let me think again.

Wait, the context doesn't mention "Goody Two Shoes" explicitly. It talks about other songs like "It Doesn't Matter Anymore," "Way Down," "More than a Woman," "My Sweet Lord," etc. So maybe I need to recall from general knowledge.

I think "Goody Two Shoes" was a song by The Beatles, but I'm not sure if they released it in the 80s. Wait, no, The Beatles were more active in the 60s. Alternatively, maybe it's a song by another artist. Let me think about the 80s UK number ones.

Wait, the context mentions that in the 80s, after John Lennon's death, his singles re-entered the charts. But the specific song "Goody Two Shoes" isn't mentioned here. So perhaps the answer is that it's by The Beatles, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's by another artist.

Wait, another angle: the context says that in the 80s, after their deaths, John Lennon and George Harrison had posthumous number ones. But the question is about "Goody Two Shoes." I think "Goody Two Shoes" is a song by The Beatles, but I'm not sure if it was ['adam ant', 'adam and ant s', 'adam and ants', 'stuart goddard', 'adam ants band', 'stuart leslie goddard', 'adam ant ants', 'stuart l goddard', 'adam ants', 'adam and ant', 'adam ant s', 'adam and ants band']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The cathedral could be the fourth church on the site at Ludgate Hill dedicated to St Paul. A devastating fire in 1087, detailed in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, destroyed much of the city and the cathedral.  King William I donated the stone from the destroyed Palatine Tower on the River Fleet towards the construction of a new, Romanesque Norman cathedral, sometimes said to be his last act before his death.

The cathedral was already in severe structural decline by the 17th century. Restoration work by Inigo Jones in the 1620s was halted by the English Civil War. Sir Christopher Wren was attempting another restoration in 1666 when the cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. After demolition of the old structure, the present, domed cathedral was erected on the site, with an English Baroque design by Wren. 

Construction

After a succession of storms, in 1255 Bishop Fulk Basset appealed for funds to repair the damaged roof. The roof was once more rebuilt in wood, which was ultimately to doom the building. At this time, the east end of the cathedral church was lengthened, enclosing the parish church of St Faith, which was now brought within the cathedral. The eastward addition was always referred to as "The New Work".

Work on the cathedral began during the reign of William the Conqueror after a fire in 1087 that destroyed much of the city. Work took more than 200 years, and construction was delayed by another fire in 1135. The church was consecrated in 1240 and enlarged again in 1256 and the early 14th century. At its completion in the middle of the 14th century, the cathedral was one of the longest churches in the world and had one of the tallest spires and some of the finest stained glass.

Work stopped during the English Civil War, and there was much defacement and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during which old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed, and the nave used as a stable for cavalry horses.  Much of the detailed information historians have of the cathedral is taken from William Dugdale's 1658 History of St Pauls Cathedral, written hastily during The Protectorate for fear that "one of the most eminent Structures of that kinde in theChristian World" might be destroyed.



Question: Which English cathedral was damaged by an earthquake in the middle Ages and later had its nave used as a stable for cavalry horses during the English Civil War?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which English cathedral was damaged by an earthquake in the middle ages and later had its nave used as a stable for cavalry horses during the English Civil War. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The context talks about St. Paul's Cathedral in London. It mentions that there was a fire in 1087, which destroyed much of the city and the cathedral. King William I donated a stone from the destroyed Palatine Tower towards building a new Norman cathedral. The cathedral was in severe structural decline by the 17th century, and there were restoration attempts by Inigo Jones in the 1620s, but the English Civil War halted that. Then, Sir Christopher Wren tried another restoration in 1666, but the Great Fire of London destroyed it again. After that, a new domed cathedral was built with Wren's design.

Additionally, the context mentions that in 1255, Bishop Fulk Basset appealed for funds to repair the roof, which was rebuilt in wood, leading to its eventual destruction. The east end was lengthened, enclosing the parish church of St. Faith, referred to as "The New Work." The construction started after the 1087 fire, took over 200 years, was delayed by another fire in 1135, and was consecrated in 1240. It was enlarged again in 1256 and the early 14th century. At completion, it was one of the longest and had the tallest spire and finest stained glass. Work stopped during the English Civil War, where the nave was used as a stable for cavalry horses, causing defacement and destruction. Historians rely on William Dugdale's 1658 History of St. Paul's Cathedral.

Now, the question is asking which English cathedral was damaged by an earthquake in the middle ages and later had its nave used as a stable during the English Civil War.

From the context, St. Paul's Cathedral fits both points. It was damaged by fires and had its nave used as a stable during the English Civil War. The context doesn't mention an earthquake, but the question includes that detail, so I might have missed it. Wait, the context doesn't explicitly mention an earthquake. It talks about fires in 1087 and 1135, but not an earthquake. Hmm, maybe I need to infer or check if St. Paul's was indeed damaged by an earthquake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other cathedrals. But the context is specifically about St. Paul's. So maybe the question is referring to St. Paul's, and the mention of an earthquake is a detail I might have overlooked. Alternatively, perhaps the context is implying that it was damaged by an earthquake, but I don't see that in the text.

Question: Who were On The Road Again in 1968?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who "On The Road Again" refers to in the context provided. Let me look through the context step by step.

First, I see that the context includes various events from January 2 to January 27, 1968. There are mentions of media purchases, marches, sports events, political handovers, launches, and cultural milestones. 

Looking specifically for the phrase "On The Road Again," I don't see it directly mentioned in the events listed. However, I notice that on January 26, Elvis Presley starts recording sessions in Memphis, which include songs like "Suspicious Minds" and "In the Ghetto." The question is about who was "On The Road Again," which might be a reference to a song or an album.

Wait, the album "On the Road Again" by The Grateful Dead was released in 1968. But in the context provided, the only mention related to music is Led Zeppelin's first album being released on January 12. There's no mention of The Grateful Dead or their album in the context.

Alternatively, maybe it's referring to someone else. Let me think about other artists or events in 1968. The New York Jets defeating the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III is mentioned on January 12. Joe Namath is the MVP. But that doesn't fit the phrase.

Wait, the context also mentions that on January 26, Elvis Presley starts recording sessions. The song "On the Road Again" is a song by The Grateful Dead, but perhaps the question is referring to someone else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to a person, not a song.

Wait, looking again, the context includes a list of people born on certain dates. For example, on January 2, Dean Francis Alfar, Tommy Morrison, Christy Turlington, and Robby Gordon are born. On January 3, Michael Schumacher is born. On January 5, Marilyn Manson. On January 6, Norman Reedus. On January 8, Jeff Abercrombie. On January 11, Ky≈çko Hikami. 

Wait, none of these names seem to match "On the Road Again." Maybe it's a reference to a band or a song. Since the context mentions Led Zeppelin's first album on January 12, perhaps the question is referring to them, but "On the Road Again" isn't a song of theirs.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to a movie or a book. But I don't see any mention of that in the context.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. The phrase "On the Road Again" is from the song "On the Road Again" by The Grateful Dead, released in 1968. But since the context provided doesn't mention that, maybe the answer is that it's referring to The Grateful ['adolfo de la para', 'richard hite musician', 'canned heat']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The origins of Donald Duck's name may have been inspired by Australian cricket legend Donald Bradman. In 1932 Bradman and the Australian team were touring North America and he made the news after being dismissed for a duck against New York West Indians. Walt Disney was in the process of creating a friend for Mickey Mouse when he possibly read about Bradman's dismissal in the papers and decided to name the new character "Donald Duck".  Voice performer Clarence Nash auditioned for Walt Disney

Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all timein 2002.  He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character,  and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.

* Donald is the only popular film and television cartoon character to appear as a mascot for a major American university: a licensing agreement between Disney and the University of Oregon allows the school's sports teams to use Donald's image as its "Fighting Duck" mascot. In 1984, Donald Duck was named an honorary alumnus of the University of Oregon during his 50th birthday celebration. During a visit to the Eugene Airport, 3,000 to 4,000 fans gathered for the presentation of an academic capand gown to Donald. Thousands of area residents signed a congratulatory scroll for Donald, and that document is now part of Disney's corporate archives.

Donald Duck first appeared in the 1934 cartoon The Wise Little Hen which was part of the Silly Symphonies series of theatrical cartoon shorts. The film's release date of June 9 is officially recognized by the Walt Disney Company as Donald's birthday  despite a couple in-universe contradictions.  Donald's appearance in the cartoon, as created by animator Dick Lundy, is similar to his modern look¬†‚Äì the feather and beak colors are the same, as is the blue sailor shirt and hat¬†‚Äì but his features

Donald Duck (Kalle Anka in Sweden,  Anders And in Denmark, Andr√©s √ñnd in Iceland, Donald Duck in Norway,  and Aku Ankka in Finland) is a very popular character in Nordic countries. In the mid-1930s, Robert S. Hartman, a German who served as a representative of Walt Disney, visited Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst (The Art of Fables). Hartman found a studio called L'Atelj√© Dekorat√∂r, which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst. Since the Disney



Question: What is Donald Duck's middle name?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out Donald Duck's middle name based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully to find any clues.

The context starts by mentioning that Donald Duck's name might have been inspired by Australian cricket legend Donald Bradman. It talks about how Walt Disney named the character after reading about Bradman's dismissal in 1932. Then it goes into details about Donald's appearance, his personality, and various facts about his popularity and other achievements.

Wait, the context mentions that Donald Duck is the only popular film and television cartoon character to appear as a mascot for a major American university. It specifically says that the University of Oregon uses Donald's image as its "Fighting Duck" mascot. The context also notes that in 1984, Donald was named an honorary alumnus of the University of Oregon during his 50th birthday celebration. So, the University of Oregon is involved here.

Now, the question is about Donald Duck's middle name. I'm trying to recall if Donald Duck has a middle name in the Disney universe. From what I know, Donald Duck is often just referred to as Donald, but sometimes in media, characters have middle names. However, in the context provided, I don't see any mention of a middle name. The context talks about his appearance, personality, and his role as a mascot, but not his name beyond Donald.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The context doesn't explicitly state his middle name, so perhaps the answer is that he doesn't have one, or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, sometimes in Disney, characters have middle names, but I'm not sure about Donald. Let me think again. The context doesn't mention a middle name, so maybe the answer is that he doesn't have one, or perhaps it's "Duck" as a middle name, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, no, the context says that his name was inspired by Donald Bradman, but that doesn't necessarily mean his middle name is anything specific. The context doesn't provide any information about his middle name, so perhaps the answer is that he doesn't have a middle name, or maybe it's not mentioned here.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for his middle name. Since the context doesn't provide it, maybe the answer is that he doesn't have one, or perhaps it's "Jr." or something else, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the middle name is "Anka" or another name from other languages, but that's his name in different countries, not his middle name.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the context again. The context mentions that Donald Duck was named after Donald Bradman, but doesn't specify a middle name. It also talks about his appearance, personality, and his role as a mascot, but nothing about his name beyond Donald.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected

The word vegetable was first recorded in English in the early 15th century. It comes from Old French,  and was originally applied to all plants; the word is still used in this sense in biological contexts. It derives from Medieval Latin vegetabilis "growing, flourishing" (i.e. of a plant), a semantic change from a Late Latin meaning "to be enlivening, quickening".

The mainstay of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons and lentils.  In Ancient Rome a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots. 

Some common vegetablesNutrition and health

In Ancient China, rice was the staple crop in the south and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles and pancakes. Vegetables used to accompany these included yams, soya beans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions,leeks, garlic, radishes and lettuces.

Vegetables have been part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying



Question: What is the oldest vegetable known to man?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the oldest vegetable known to man is, based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully to find any clues.

The context starts by talking about how vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation around 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. It mentions that initially, plants that grew locally were cultivated, but later, trade brought exotic crops. So, the earliest vegetables would have been those that were wild and locally available.

Then, looking further into the context, it discusses the diet of Ancient Greeks and Romans. The Ancient Greeks had a diet with bread, cheese, olives, figs, fish, and some meat, including vegetables like onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. The Romans had a diet based on emmer wheat or beans, with green vegetables and little meat, and they grew broad beans, peas, onions, and turnips.

In Ancient China, the staple crops were rice and wheat, with vegetables like yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The Egyptians had a diet with bread, contaminated with sand, meat as a luxury, and fish, along with vegetables like marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.

The context also mentions that vegetables have been part of the human diet from time immemorial, some as staples, others as accessories. It notes that some are perennials, others annuals or biennials, and that cultivation involves preparing the soil by loosening it.

Now, the question is: What is the oldest vegetable known to man?

From the context, the earliest period mentioned is around 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC when agriculture developed. So, the vegetables that were first cultivated would be those that were wild and available in those regions. The context doesn't specify which specific vegetable was the first, but it does mention that initially, locally growing plants were cultivated.

However, in the part discussing the word "vegetable," it's noted that the term comes from Old French and was originally applied to all plants, still used in biological contexts. The term comes from Medieval Latin "vegetabilis," meaning "growing, flourishing," which in turn comes from Late Latin "to be enlivening, quickening."

But the key point is that vegetables were first cultivated around 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. The context doesn't specify a particular vegetable, but it does mention that the first vegetables were those that were locally available. So, the oldest known vegetable would be one that was among the first to be cultivated, which would be around that time period.

Looking at the context again, it doesn't name a specific vegetable, but it does mention that the first crops were likely those that were wild and locally available ['green pea', 'pisum sativus', 'garden pea', 'pea plants', 'peascods', 'pea pod', 'pea plant', 'p sativum', 'petit pois', 'green peas', 'pea', 'pisum sativum', 'peas', 'field peas']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Christian Dior (; 21 January 1905 ‚Äì 23 October 1957) was a French fashion designer, best known as the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, also called Christian Dior, which is now owned by Groupe Arnault.

Early life

From 1937, Dior was employed by the fashion designer Robert Piguet, who gave him the opportunity to design for three Piguet collections. Dior would later say that 'Robert Piguet taught me the virtues of simplicity through which true elegance must come.'  One of his original designs for Piguet, a day dress with a short, full skirt called "Cafe Anglais", was particularly well received. Whilst at Piguet, Dior worked alongside Pierre Balmain, and was succeeded as house designer by Marc Bohan ‚Äì whowould, in 1960, become head of design for Christian Dior Paris. Dior left Piguet when he was called up for military service.

In 1946 Marcel Boussac, a successful entrepreneur known as the richest man in France, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. On 8 December 1946, with Boussac's backing, Dior founded his fashion house. The actual name of the line of his first collection, presented on 12 February 1947,  was Corolle (literally the botanical term corolla or circlet of

In 1942, when Dior left the army, he joined the fashion house of Lucien Lelong, where he and Balmain were the primary designers. For the duration of World War II, Dior, as an employee of Lelong ‚Äî who labored to preserve the French fashion industry during wartime for economic and artistic reasons ‚Äî designed dresses for the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators, as did other fashion houses that remained in business during the war, including Jean Patou, Jeanne Lanvin, and Nina Ricci.

Christian Dior was born in Granville, a seaside town on the coast of Normandy, France. He was the second of five children born to Maurice Dior, a wealthy fertilizer manufacturer (the family firm was Dior Fr√®res), and his wife, formerly Isabelle Cardamone. He had four siblings: Raymond (father of Fran√ßoise Dior), Jacqueline, Bernard, and Catherine Dior.Pochna, M-F. (1996). Christian Dior: The Man Who Made the World Look New p. 5, Arcade Publishing. ISBN 1-55970-340-7. When Christian was aboutfive years old, the family moved to Paris, but still returned to the Normandy coast for summer holidays.



Question: Which fashion designer became head of Christian Dior in 1996?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which fashion designer became the head of Christian Dior in 1996. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

The context talks about Christian Dior's early life and his career. It mentions that after leaving the army in 1942, he joined the fashion house of Lucien Lelong, where he and Balmain were the primary designers. Then, after the war, he worked for Lelong until he founded his own brand in 1946.

Wait, the context also mentions that Marc Bohan became head of design for Christian Dior Paris, but it doesn't specify the year. However, the question is about the head in 1996. I know that after Dior's death in 1957, the company was taken over by Groupe Arnault. So, the head after Dior would have been someone else, possibly a member of the Arnault family.

Wait, the context doesn't directly mention who took over in 1996. But I recall that in real life, after Dior's death, the company was managed by his family until it was sold to LVMH (Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy) in 1989. Then, in 1996, the CEO was Patrick Robin, but I'm not sure if he was the head of design or the CEO. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else.

Wait, the context says that in 1960, Marc Bohan became head of design for Christian Dior Paris. So, Bohan was the head of design, not the CEO. The CEO in 1996 would be someone else, perhaps from the Arnault group.

Wait, the context doesn't mention the CEO in 1996, but I think in real life, after the sale to LVMH, the CEO was Patrick Robin. But the question is about the head of Christian Dior, which might refer to the CEO or the head designer.

Wait, the context mentions that in 1960, Marc Bohan became head of design. So, the head of design was Bohan until he retired. But the question is about the head in 1996, so perhaps the CEO at that time was someone else, maybe from the Arnault group.

Wait, the context doesn't specify, but I think the answer is that in 1996, the CEO was someone else, perhaps not mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe the head designer was still Marc Bohan, but I think he retired earlier.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The context says that in 1960, Marc Bohan became head of design for Christian Dior Paris. So, he was the head designer until he retired. So, in 1996, he was still the head designer, unless he had retired by then.

Wait, the context doesn't specify when Marc Bohan retired. If he was ['john galliano', 'miss dior cherie']

She opened her second shop six months later. On her husband's return, he joined the business. By 1991, the Body Shop had 700 branches, and Roddick was awarded the1991 World Vision Award for Development Initiative.  In 1993 she told Third Way Magazine:

Dame Anita Lucia Roddick, DBE (23 October 1942 ‚Äì 10 September 2007) was a British businesswoman, human rights activist and environmental campaigner, best known as the founder of The Body Shop, a cosmetics company producing and retailing natural beauty products that shaped ethical consumerism.   The company was one of the first to prohibit the use of ingredients tested on animals and one of the first to promote fair trade with third world countries.

Jon Entine notes that Roddick copied the name, concept and original brochures from the original Body Shop, which was started in San Francisco and had three stores when Roddick visited the Bay area in the early 1970s. Roddick's original brochures were word-for-word copies of material produced by the San Francisco-based Body Shop. When Roddick decided to expand her multinational corporation into the United States, she bought the rights to the Body Shop name from the original shop owners in

Question: Where did Anita Roddick open her first Body Shop?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where Anita Roddick opened her first Body Shop. Let me read through the context provided carefully. 

The context mentions that Roddick opened the first Body Shop in 1976. It also says she made this move while her husband was away in South America. So, the primary location is 1976, but I should check if there's more detail about the exact location.

Looking further, the context states that she opened her second shop six months later. It doesn't specify where the second shop was, but the first one was in 1976. The context also mentions that her husband joined the business upon his return, but doesn't give a location for that. 

Wait, the context also mentions that Jon Entine notes that Roddick copied the name and concept from a Body Shop in San Francisco. She visited there in the early 1970s and copied their brochures. So, the original Body Shop was in San Francisco, but Roddick opened her own in the UK, I think. 

Wait, no, the context says she opened the first Body Shop in 1976. It doesn't specify the location beyond the UK, but the original Body Shop in San Francisco was already there. So, perhaps the first Body Shop by Roddick was in the UK, but the original was in San Francisco. 

Wait, the context says she opened the first Body Shop in 1976 with the aim of making income while her husband was away. So, the location is likely the UK, but the original Body Shop was in San Francisco. So, the answer is the UK, specifically England, but the context doesn't specify the exact city beyond that she opened the first one in 1976. 

Wait, the context says she opened her second shop six months later, but doesn't specify where. So, the first one was in 1976, but where exactly?

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Robert Newton "Bob" Ford (December 8, 1861 ‚Äì June 8, 1892) was an American outlaw best known for killing his gang leader Jesse James in April 1882, to collect a reward. For about a year, Ford and his older brother Charles performed paid re-enactments of the killing at publicity events. Later he drifted around the West, operating saloons and dance halls.

By the spring of 1882, with his gang depleted by arrests, deaths, and defections, James thought that he could trust only the Ford brothers.  Charles had been out on raids with James before, but Bob was an eager new recruit. The Fords resided in St. Joseph with the James family, where Jesse went by the alias Thomas Howard. The Ford brothers passed themselves off as Bob and Charles Johnson, Howard's cousins.

Hoping to keep the gang alive, James invited the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City Bank in Missouri, but the brothers had already decided not to participate; rather, they intended to collect the $10,000 bounty placed on James by Governor Thomas T. Crittenden. In January 1882, Bob Ford and James gang member Dick Liddil had surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at their sister Martha Bolton's residence in Ray County. They were brought into a meeting with Crittenden, as they

Three days after the fire, on June 8, 1892, Edward O'Kelley entered Ford's tent saloon with a shotgun. According to witnesses, Ford's back was turned. O'Kelley said, "Hello, Bob." As Ford turned to see who it was, O'Kelley fired both barrels, killing Ford instantly. O'Kelley hence became "the man who killed the man who killed Jesse James". O'Kelley's sentence was commuted because of a medical condition, and he was released on October 3, 1902.   O'Kelley was subsequently killed on January 13,1904 while trying to shoot a policeman.Ford was buried in Creede. His remains were later exhumed and reburied in Richmond Cemetery, in his native Ray County at Richmond. 

Cultural depictions

Films

Public opinion turned against the Fords for betraying their gang leader, and Bob was seen as a coward and traitor for killing James. This sentiment warred with the opinion that it had been time for James to be stopped. For a period, Bob earned money by posing for photographs as "the man who killed Jesse James" in dime museums.  He also appeared on stage with his brother Charles, reenacting the murder in a touring stage show.



Question: Which American gang of outlaws from the old west had the christian names Robert, Grattan and Emett?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which American gang of outlaws from the Old West had the Christian names Robert, Grattan, and Emett. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

The context talks about Robert Newton "Bob" Ford, an American outlaw known for killing Jesse James. It mentions that Bob and his brother Charles performed re-enactments of the killing for publicity. Later, Bob operated saloons and drifted around the West. The context also describes the events leading up to Bob's death in 1892.

Now, the question is asking about a gang with three members who have the Christian names Robert, Grattan, and Emett. From the context, I know Bob Ford is Robert Newton Ford. But the context doesn't mention Grattan or Emett as part of his gang. However, the context does mention that Bob Ford and his brother Charles were part of the gang, but their last names are Ford, not Grattan or Emett.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The context doesn't explicitly state that the Ford brothers are Grattan and Emett. It only mentions Bob and Charles Ford. So perhaps the answer is that the Ford brothers are the ones, but their last names are Ford, not Grattan or Emett. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another gang, but the context provided doesn't mention any other gang members with those names.

Wait, the context mentions that Bob Ford and his brother Charles performed re-enactments, but the question is about a gang with three members: Robert, Grattan, and Emett. Since the context only mentions Bob and Charles Ford, perhaps the answer is that the Ford brothers are Robert and Charles, but the third member isn't mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick, and the answer is that the Ford brothers are the ones, but their last names don't match the first names given.

Wait, the question specifies Christian names, so it's about the first names. The context mentions Robert Newton Ford, but not Grattan or Emett. So perhaps the answer is that the Ford brothers are Robert and Charles, but the third name isn't in the context. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another gang, but the context doesn't provide that information.

Wait, the context mentions that Bob Ford and his brother Charles performed re-enactments, but the question is about a gang with three members: Robert, Grattan, and Emett. Since the context only mentions Bob and Charles, perhaps the answer is that the Ford brothers are Robert and Charles, but the third member isn't named here. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the Ford brothers are Robert and Charles, but the third member isn't part of the context provided. So the answer ['dalton brothers', 'bill power outlaw', 'dalton gang']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The previous two Opens at St Andrews, in 2000 and 2005, were both won by Tiger Woods, the first with a record 19-under-par total. The primary change to the course from 2005 was at the par-4 17th hole; a new tee extended the Road Hole to 495 yd, an increase of 40 yd.   Although not altered, the measurement angle of the dogleg was revised for hole #7, resulting in a new length of 371 yd, a reduction of 19 yd.

Card of the course

The 2010 Open Championship was held 15‚Äì18 July over the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. It was the 150th anniversary of the founding of The Open in 1860,  and the 28th time The Open was played at St Andrews. While the tournament is usually branded with the edition of the championship (for example, the previous year's Open was branded as the "138th Open Championship"), due to the special anniversary the R&A branded this tournament as the "150th Anniversary Open Championship", instead ofusing what would have been the normal "139th Open Championship" branding. The standard branding returned the following year.

St Andrews is considered to be the home of golf, and as such, the current Open Championship rota means that the Old Course plays host to the championship every five years. Given the course's standing, even more attention is given to The Open whenever it visits the historic links.

For the 28th time, the Open Championship took to the Old Course at St Andrews, and it played perhaps the easiest it has in all its history. Overall, 73 golfers played their first round under par. The round of the day was by Rory McIlroy, who tied a major championship record with a round of 63 which was good for ‚àí9. It was only the eighth 63 in Open Championship history, and 22nd time a 63 has been carded in major championship history.  McIlroy was bogey free and played his last ten holes at ‚àí8.

Question: In 1968 what became the longest course used for the British Open golf championship?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what became the longest course used for the British Open golf championship in 1968. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

The context mentions several things about the Open Championships, particularly focusing on the 2010 event at St Andrews. It talks about the course changes over the years, like the extension of the 17th hole and the adjustment for the 7th hole. But the question is about 1968, which is quite a bit earlier than the context provided.

Wait, the context doesn't directly mention anything about 1968. It starts from 2000 onwards. So I might need to think about what I know from general golf history. The British Open, now known as The Open, has been played at various courses, primarily St Andrews, but also others like Royal Lytham & St Annes, Hoylake, and others.

In 1968, the Open was played at St Andrews, I believe. But the question is about what became the longest course used for the British Open that year. So I'm trying to recall if there was a significant change in the course length around that time.

Looking at the context, it mentions that in 2005, the 17th hole was extended to 495 yards from 455 yards. So that was a 40-yard extension. But that was in 2005, not 1968. So that's not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the course setup in 1968. I think in the 1960s, the courses were longer than they are now, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the specific course at St Andrews. The Old Course at St Andrews has been the home of the Open since 1892, I think. So in 1968, it was used again.

I recall that the R&A (Royal and Ancient Golf Club) has been adjusting the courses over the years to maintain the challenge. But I don't remember any major changes in 1968 specifically. However, the context provided doesn't mention anything about 1968, so I might need to infer based on the information given.

Wait, the context does mention that in 2005, the 17th hole was extended, making it 495 yards. So perhaps in 1968, the course was longer than that? Or maybe the question is referring to a change that happened in 1968, but the context doesn't mention it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is that the course at St Andrews was the longest, as it's the home course. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about what became the longest course used for the British Open in 1968. So I'm looking for a change in that specific year. Since the context provided doesn't mention 1968, maybe I should look elsewhere.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Sherman's March to the Sea is the name commonly given to the military Savannah Campaign in the American Civil War, conducted through Georgia from November 15 to December 21, 1864 by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman of the Union Army. The campaign began with Sherman's troops leaving the captured city of Atlanta, Georgia, on November 15 and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21. His forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian

Sherman's "March to the Sea" followed his successful Atlanta Campaign of May to September 1864. He and the Union Army's commander, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, believed that the Civil War would come to an end only if the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological capacity for warfare were decisively broken.  Sherman therefore planned an operation that has been compared to the modern principles of scorched earth warfare, or total war. Although his formal orders (excerpted below)

Station. Howard's infantry marched through Jonesboro to Gordon, southwest of the state capital, Milledgeville. Slocum's wing, accompanied by Sherman, moved to the east, in the direction of Augusta. They destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and then turned south.

Union soldiers sang many songs during the March, but it is one written afterward that has come to symbolize the campaign: "Marching Through Georgia", written by Henry Clay Work in 1865. Sung from the point of view of a Union soldier, the lyrics detail the freeing of slaves and punishing the Confederacy for starting the war. Coincidentally, Sherman came to dislike the song, in part because he was never one to rejoice over a fallen foe, and in part because it was played at almost every publicappearance that he attended.  It was widely popular among US soldiers of 20th-century wars.

The March to the Sea was devastating to Georgia and the Confederacy. Sherman himself estimated that the campaign had inflicted $100 million (about $1.4 billion in 2010 dollars)  in destruction, about one fifth of which "inured to our advantage" while the "remainder is simple waste and destruction." The Army wrecked 300 mi of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines. It seized 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 13,000 head of cattle. It confiscated 9.5 million pounds of corn and



Question: Which city in Georgia was burned by General Sherman during the American Civil War?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which city in Georgia was burned by General Sherman during the American Civil War. Let me start by recalling what I know about Sherman's March to the Sea. I remember that Sherman was a Union general who led a significant military campaign in Georgia during the Civil War. The campaign was part of the broader Union strategy to break the Confederacy's will and capacity to fight.

From the context provided, it mentions that Sherman's campaign started after the capture of Atlanta in November 1864. The campaign lasted until December 21, 1864, when the port of Savannah was captured. The context also talks about the destruction of military targets, infrastructure, and civilian property. It specifically mentions that Sherman's forces destroyed industry, infrastructure, and civilian goods, which aligns with the concept of total war.

The question is asking which specific city was burned. I know that Atlanta was a major city and a significant target during the war. Sherman captured Atlanta in the Atlanta Campaign, which was from May to September 1864. After that, he moved towards Savannah, leading his troops southwards. Along the way, they destroyed various resources and infrastructure, including railroads and bridges.

Wait, but the context mentions that the campaign began with Sherman leaving Atlanta on November 15. So, Atlanta was captured earlier, but during the March to the Sea, Sherman's troops were moving south, not necessarily burning Atlanta again. However, the context also states that Sherman's forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property. It doesn't explicitly say that Atlanta was burned again, but since the campaign started after Atlanta's capture, it's possible that Atlanta was already destroyed or damaged in the Atlanta Campaign.

But the question is about the March to the Sea, which is specifically the Savannah Campaign. So, perhaps the city burned during this specific phase was Savannah. However, the context says that Savannah was captured on December 21, 1864, but it doesn't mention it being burned. Instead, it focuses on the destruction along the way, including the burning of other towns and infrastructure.

Wait, the context mentions that Sherman's forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property. It also says that they destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and turned south. It doesn't explicitly name the cities burned, but it does say that the campaign was devastating to Georgia and the Confederacy.

I think the key point is that Sherman's March to the Sea involved burning many towns and infrastructure as they moved south. The specific city that was burned during this campaign is likely Savannah, but the context doesn't explicitly state that it was burned. However, the destruction was widespread, so it's possible that multiple cities were affected.

Wait, the context mentions that Sherman's forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property. It also says that they destroyed 300 miles of railroad, numerous bridges ['city of atlanta', 'atlanta ga', 'atlanta united states', 'atlanta', 'atlanta georgia', 'city of atlanta ga', 'georgia state capital', 'marthasville ga', 'culture of atlanta', 'atanta ga', 'atlanta usa', 'terminus georgia', 'atlanta georgia usa', 't l', 'culture of atlanta georgia', 'un locode usatl', 'hotlanta', 'atlanta georgia u s state', 'big peach', 'atl', 'terminus ga', 'city in forest', 'population of atlanta']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Canadian 25-cent coin, or "quarter" features a depiction of a caribou on one face. The caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut.

Question: What is the official animal of Canada?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the official animal of Canada based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully to find the relevant information.

The context mentions several caribou subspecies and herds in Canada. It talks about the Peary caribou, the boreal woodland caribou, the George River caribou herd, and others. It also mentions that the caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut. Additionally, it refers to the Canadian 25-cent coin featuring a caribou.

Wait, the question is asking for the official animal of Canada, not just a provincial one. I know that some provinces have official animals, but what about the whole country? Let me think. The context doesn't explicitly state that the caribou is Canada's official animal, but it does mention it's the provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut. However, I recall from general knowledge that the caribou isn't the official animal of Canada as a whole. Maybe the official animal is something else, like the maple leaf isn't an animal. Wait, perhaps the official animal is the beaver? I think I've heard that before. But the context here doesn't mention the beaver. Hmm.

Wait, the context does mention that the caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, but not of Canada as a whole. So maybe the official animal of Canada is the beaver. But the context provided doesn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is that the official animal of Canada is the caribou, but I'm not sure because it's only the provincial animal. Alternatively, maybe the context implies that the caribou is the official animal because it's mentioned in relation to the country's memorials and coins.

Wait, the context says that the caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's also on the coat of arms of Nunavut. It doesn't explicitly say it's the official animal of Canada. So perhaps the answer is that the official animal of Canada is the caribou, but I'm not entirely certain because it's only for specific provinces. Alternatively, maybe the official animal is the beaver, but the context doesn't mention that. Since the context doesn't provide information about the beaver, I have to go with what's given.

Wait, the context does mention that the caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's also present on the coat of arms of Nunavut. It's possible that the caribou is considered a symbol of Canada as a whole, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the official animal is the moose or another species. But the context doesn't mention that. So, based on the context, the caribou ['beaverdams', 'beaver pelt', 'beaverdam habitat', 'beaver', 'beavers', 'beaver lodge', 'beaver houses', 'castor zoology', 'salt water beavers', 'beaver house', 'castor genus', 'beever']

Question: In children's TV by what name is Sir Topham Hatt better known?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "In children's TV by what name is Sir Topham Hatt better known?" using the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to find any clues.

The context is about a children's TV series called "The Woodentops," which first aired on BBC Television in 1955. It was created by Freda Lingstrom and Maria Bird. The show features a middle-class family living on a farm, and it's aimed at teaching pre-school children about family life. The main characters include the Woodentop family: Daddy, Mummy, Jenny, Willy, and Baby Woodentop. There are also other characters like Mrs. Scrubbitt, Sam Scrubbitt, and Buttercup the Cow.

The context mentions that the original puppets were stolen in 1983 but later returned and are now in the Museum of London. It also talks about the show appearing in a music video for BBC Children in Need in 2009, but the main focus is on the original series.

Now, the question is about Sir Topham Hatt. I don't see the name "Sir Topham Hatt" mentioned in the context provided. The context discusses "The Woodentops" and its characters but doesn't mention Sir Topham Hatt. However, I recall that Sir Topham Hatt is a character from another children's TV show, specifically "Thomas & Friends," which is a spin-off of "Shining Times." The show features a talking train named Thomas. Sir Topham Hatt is a character who is the manager of the railway and is known for his tall hat and kind demeanor.

Since the context given is about "The Woodentops," and the question is about Sir Topham Hatt, it's possible that the question is mixing up different shows. However, based on the provided context, there's no mention of Sir Topham Hatt. Therefore, the answer would be that Sir Topham Hatt is not mentioned in the given context, but in the context of children's TV, he is known as Sir Topham Hatt, the kind and wise manager of the railway.

Wait, but the question is asking by what name he's better known in children's TV. Since the context doesn't mention him, perhaps the answer is that he's known as Sir Topham Hatt, but that's just restating his name. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick because the context is about "The Woodentops," not "Thomas & Friends." So, in the context provided, Sir Topham Hatt isn't mentioned, so the answer would be that he's not mentioned here, but in reality, he's known as Sir Topham Hatt from "Thomas & Friends."

But the question is specifically asking based on the provided context.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The most popular forms are English draughts, also called American checkers, played on an 8√ó8 checkerboard; Russian draughts, also played on an 8√ó8; and international draughts, played on a 10√ó10 board. There are many other variants played on an 8√ó8, and Canadian checkers is played on a 12√ó12 board.

General rules

* Tiers: A complex variant which allows players to upgrade their pieces beyond kings.
* 10√ó8 board for Russian draughts (2 additional columns, labelled 'i' and 'k').
* Vladimir Vigman draughts ‚Äì in which each player have 24 pieces (two full set) ‚Äî one on the white squares, second on the black. Each player play two game simultaneously: one game at white squares, other game at dark squares. Total result is sum results of both games.

However, other problems have only polynomial complexity: 
* Can one player remove all the other player‚Äôs pieces in one move (by several jumps)? 
* Can one player king a piece in one move?

* Cheskers: A variant invented by Solomon Golomb.  Each player begins with a bishop and a camel (which jumps with coordinates (3,1) rather than (2,1) so as to stay on the black squares), and men reaching the back rank promote to a bishop, camel, or king.
* Damath: A variant utilizing math principles and numbered chips popular in the Philippines.

* Dameo: A a variant played on an 8√ó8 board, move and capture rules are similar to those of Armenian draughts. A special "sliding" move is used for moving a line of checkers similar to the movement rule in Epaminondas. By Christian Freeling (2000). 
* Hexdame: A a literal adaptation of international draughts to a hexagonal gameboard. By Christian Freeling (1979).
* Island Checkers: Uses a 6√ó6 board, allows trapping and swapping pieces, and jumping your own.



Question: If you had two eight enders in one bonspiel what are you playing?
</think><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question: "If you had two eight enders in one bonspiel what are you playing?" I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the terms used here. The question mentions "eight enders" and "bonspiel." I know that in checkers, pieces are often referred to by their sizes, like "king" or "queen." But "ender" isn't a term I'm familiar with. Maybe it's a typo or a specific term from a particular variant.

Looking at the context provided, there are several variants mentioned, like English draughts, Russian draughts, international draughts, and others. The context also talks about different board sizes, such as 8x8, 10x10, and 12x12. It mentions that Canadian checkers is played on a 12x12 board.

The question is about having two eight enders in a bonspiel. "Bonspiel" is a term I've heard before, I think it's a Yiddish term for a game or tournament, similar to a chess tournament. So, in this context, it's like a checkers tournament.

Now, "eight enders" ‚Äì if I think about standard checkers, the pieces are usually called "kings" when they reach the back rank. So, maybe "eight enders" refers to pieces that have reached the eighth rank, making them kings. So, having two eight enders would mean each player has two kings on their side.

But wait, in standard checkers, each player has 12 pieces: 12 regular pieces and 12 kings. So, if you have two eight enders, does that mean each player has two kings? Or does it mean something else?

Looking back at the context, there's a mention of a variant called "Vladimir Vigman draughts," where each player has 24 pieces, split into two sets on white and black squares. Each player plays two games simultaneously. But that might not be directly relevant here.

Another variant is "Cheskers," which uses a bishop and a camel, but that's a different setup. "Damath" uses numbered chips, and "Dameo" and "Hexdame" are other variants with different rules.

Wait, the question is about having two eight enders in a bonspiel. Since "bonspiel" refers to a tournament, perhaps it's asking what variant of checkers is being played where each player has two pieces on the eighth rank, which are the enders.

In standard checkers, each player has 12 pieces, and the kings are on the eighth rank. So, if you have two eight enders, maybe it's referring to having two kings each. But that doesn't quite make sense because ['cUrling sheet', 'cUrling rink', 'cUrling shoes', 'button cUrling', 'hammer cUrling', 'cUrling stone', 'roaring game', 'cUrling sport', 'cUrling', 'sweeping sport', 'cUrling broom', 'chess on ice', 'cUrling rock', 'history of cUrling', 'free guard zone']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The British Landrace is a British domestic breed of pig and one of the most popular in the United Kingdom. It is white with heavy drooping ears that cover most of the face and is bred for pork and bacon. The breed originated in the 1949 importation of 12 landrace pigs from Scandinavia¬†‚Äî four boars and eight gilts (immature females). In 1950, the British Landrace Pig Society was formed and it opened a herd book for the first offspring born from the imported 12. They created the first pig testingscheme with  a testing station at the village of Stockton-on-the-Forest in North Yorkshire.

The breed's popularity may have contributed to a decline in rare breeds in the United Kingdom. The 1955 Howitt report by the Advisory Committee on the Development of Pig Production advised farmers to increase profitability by focusing on just three breeds of pigs¬†‚Äî  the British Landrace, the Large White and the Welsh. Many farmers acted on the report and as a result many rarer pig breeds have declined. In a 1999 book, Jules Pretty said that seven pig breeds had been lost in Britain in the 20thcentury, and that the industry was now dominated by the British Landrace and the Large White.

In 1978, the British Landrace Pig Society joined the National Pig Breeders' Association (now the British Pig Association). In the 1980s the breed was developed and its genetic base was expanded by the importation of new bloodlines from Norway and Finland. These developments have made the British Landrace unique among other Landrace breeds. The British Landrace is also used to improve other breeds. These pigs are found all over the United Kingdom, particularly in the East and in Yorkshire.





Question: According to the Kennel Club what is the most popular pedigree dog in Britain?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "According to the Kennel Club what is the most popular pedigree dog in Britain?" using the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully to find the relevant information.

The context talks about the British Landrace, a pig breed, but I'm looking for information about dogs. Wait, the context doesn't mention any dogs, only pigs. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I misread the context. Let me go through it again.

The context discusses the British Landrace pig, its origin, characteristics, and impact on other pig breeds in the UK. There's no mention of dogs, let alone the Kennel Club or any specific dog breeds. So, the context doesn't provide any information related to the Kennel Club or dogs.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. Since the context is about pigs, maybe the answer isn't in there. But the question is about the Kennel Club's most popular pedigree dog in Britain. Since the context doesn't mention dogs, I can't find the answer here. Maybe the answer isn't provided, but the user expects me to infer based on general knowledge.

However, the user instructed to use the provided context, so if the context doesn't mention dogs, I can't answer the question accurately. But perhaps the user expects me to know that the most popular pedigree dog in Britain is the Labrador Retriever, based on general knowledge, even though it's not in the context.

Wait, but the user's instruction was to answer using the provided context. Since the context doesn't mention dogs, I can't provide an answer based on it. Maybe the answer isn't present, but the user expects me to say that the information isn't provided.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to realize that the context doesn't mention dogs, so the answer isn't there. But the question is about the Kennel Club's most popular dog, which I know is the Labrador Retriever. However, since the context doesn't include that, I can't use it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The context is about pigs, so the answer isn't there. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't provided in the context. But the user wants a one-sentence answer, so perhaps I should state that the answer isn't present in the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to work with what's given. So, the answer isn't in the context, but if I had to answer based on general knowledge, it's the Labrador Retriever. But since I can't use external knowledge, I can't provide that.

Wait, the user's example used context about France's capital, so the answer was Paris. In this case, the context is about pigs, so the answer isn't there. Therefore, the correct response is that ['labradour', 'labrador boundary dispute', 'labradorean', 'labrador canada', 'coast of labrador', 'labrador', 'labradorians', 'labradoreans', 'labradorian']

Question: What was the first top ten entry for Ce Ce Peniston (1992) that reached number one?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the first top ten entry for Ce Ce Peniston in 1992 that reached number one was. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ce Ce Peniston. She's a British singer, right? I remember she had a few hits in the early '90s. 

I think her biggest hit was "Crazy for You," but I'm not entirely sure if that was in 1992. Wait, let me think about the timeline. "Crazy for You" was released in 1991, I believe. So that would make it 1991, not 1992. So the question is about 1992, so I need to find her first top ten entry in 1992 that reached number one.

Looking at the context provided, I see a list of songs with their release dates. Scanning through them, I spot "Crazy for You" by Ce Ce Peniston, released in January 1992. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1991. Hmm, maybe I was mistaken. Let me double-check. If "Crazy for You" was released in January 1992, then that would be her 1992 entry. But was it her first top ten hit in that year?

Wait, the question is about the first top ten entry in 1992 that reached number one. So if "Crazy for You" was released in 1991, then in 1992, she might have had another hit. Let me look through the list again. There's "Crazy for You" in January 1992, but I don't see another song by her in 1992. So maybe "Crazy for You" was indeed her first top ten hit in 1992, even though it was released in 1991. Or perhaps the question is considering the first top ten entry in 1992, regardless of the release date.

Wait, no, the question specifies the first top ten entry in 1992 that reached number one. So if "Crazy for You" was released in 1991 but charted in 1992, that might not count as a 1992 entry. Maybe she had another song in 1992. Let me check the list again. I don't see another Ce Ce Peniston song in 1992. So perhaps "Crazy for You" was her first top ten hit, but released in 1991. So maybe the answer is "Crazy for You" as her first top ten entry in 1992, even though it was released the previous year.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the first top ten entry in 1992, regardless of release date. So "Crazy for You" would still be the answer because it was her first hit that reached number one in the UK charts in 1992.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Dykes to Watch Out For (sometimes DTWOF) was a comic strip by Alison Bechdel.  The strip, which ran from 1983 to 2008, was one of the earliest ongoing representations of lesbians in popular culture and has been called "as important to new generations of lesbians as landmark novels like Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973) and Lisa Alther's Kinflicks (1976) were to an earlier one".

* Mo Testa (given name Monica), the central character, a politically committed lesbian feminist with a tendency to kvetch.  Previously a worker at Madwimmin Bookstore who then worked briefly at Bounders Books and Muzak (a parody of Borders Books and Music) while earning a library science degree before getting a job as a reference librarian.

* Sparrow Pidgeon (birth name Prudence), former women's shelter director and New Ager-turned-atheist, who identified herself as a "bisexual lesbian" and was later involved with a straight Jewish male activist and stay-at-home dad, Stuart Goodman (jokingly thought of by the others as being "more stereotypically lesbian than many lesbians"), with whom she had a child, Jiao Raizel (or J.R.).  Lois and Stuart homeschooled Janis and J.R. Sparrow and Ginger purchased the house they had earlier shared

* Jezanna Ramsay (birth name Alberta), manager of the late lesbian bookstore Madwimmin Books, which also employed Mo, Lois, and Thea, a Jewish lesbian with multiple sclerosis who was Sydney's lover in college.  After the closure of Madwimmin due to financial woes, Thea and Jezanna appeared less frequently.  Jezanna later taught English as a second language, and Thea began teaching art to kids.

According to Bechdel, her strip was "half op-ed column and half endless, serialized Victorian novel". Characters reacted to contemporary events, including going to the Michigan Womyn's Festival, Gay Pride parades and protest marches, and having heated discussions about day-to-day events, political issues and the way lesbian culture was changing. The strip was one of the most successful and longest-running queer comic strips. It introduced the Bechdel test, a set of criteria for determininggender bias in works of entertainment, that has since found broad application.



Question: Which newsreader famously sat on a Lesbian when the Six O Clock News studio was invaded by protestors in the 1980s?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which newsreader famously sat on a lesbian when the Six O'Clock News studio was invaded by protestors in the 1980s. Let me start by breaking down the question and the context provided.

First, the context is about a comic strip called "Dykes to Watch Out For" by Alison Bechdel. It ran from 1983 to 2008 and was significant in representing lesbians in popular culture. The main characters include Mo Testa, Sparrow Pidgeon, Jezanna Ramsay, and Thea. They discuss various political and social issues, including protests and events like the Michigan Womyn's Festival and Gay Pride parades.

The question is asking about a specific historical event involving a newsreader. It mentions that in the 1980s, protestors invaded the Six O'Clock News studio, and a newsreader sat on a lesbian during this incident.

I recall that Alison Bechdel's strip often included references to real events and used fictionalized accounts. The Bechdel test was mentioned as a set of criteria for gender bias in media, which might not directly help here, but it's part of the context.

Thinking about the time period, the 1980s, and the UK, the Six O'Clock News was a prominent TV program. I remember hearing about an incident where a protest disrupted a TV show. I think it involved a group of women, possibly lesbians, disrupting a studio. The newsreader involved was a well-known figure at the time.

I believe the newsreader in question is ITN (Independent Television News) anchor Anne Diamond. She was a prominent figure, and I think she was involved in such an incident where she ended up sitting on someone during a protest. However, the question specifically mentions a lesbian, so I need to connect this to the context.

Wait, the context mentions the comic strip's characters reacting to contemporary events, including protests. So perhaps the question is referencing a fictionalized account within the strip. The strip's characters might have been involved in such an event, and the newsreader in question is one of them.

Looking at the characters, Mo Testa was a worker at Madwimmin Bookstore, Sparrow was a former shelter director, Jezanna was the manager, and Thea was Jewish. The question refers to a newsreader, so maybe it's someone else, but the context doesn't directly mention a newsreader character.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to a real-life person, not part of the strip. Since the context is about the strip, but the question is about a real event, I might need to think outside the context.

Wait, the question is phrased as "according to Bechdel," but the context doesn't mention a specific newsreader. However, the strip's characters discuss events like protests, so perhaps the question is referring to a fictionalized account ['nick witchell', 'nicholas newton henshall witchell', 'nicholas witchell']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Walter William Bygraves, OBE (16 October 1922 ‚Äì 31 August 2012), known by the stage name Max Bygraves, was an English comedian, singer, actor and variety performer. He appeared on his own television shows, sometimes performing comedy sketches between songs. He made twenty Royal Variety Performance appearances and presented numerous programmes, including Family Fortunes.

Early life

He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while rehearsing his new show, Do Re Mi,  at London‚Äôs Prince of Wales Theatre.

In 1977 UK Publishing House W H Allen published Bygraves's comic novel The Milkman's On His way.

From 1983 to 1985, Bygraves hosted Family Fortunes, taking over from his friend and fellow comedian Bob Monkhouse. He would later be succeeded as host in 1987 by Les Dennis.

He left school at 14, working at the Savoy Hotel in London as a pageboy, but was sacked for being too tall. He then became a messenger for an advertising agency in Fleet Street, before serving as a fitter in the RAF in World War II and working as a carpenter.  He changed his name to Max Bygraves in honour of comedian Max Miller. 

Career

In 1982 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 

Personal life

Bygraves married WAAF sergeant Gladys "Blossom" Murray in 1942. The couple had three children: Christine, Anthony and Maxine. Bygraves also had three other children from extramarital affairs: John Rice, Beverly Mayhew-Sass  and Stephen Rose.

Bygraves was born to Henry and Lillian (n√©e McDonnell) Bygraves (who wed in 1919) in London, where he grew up in poverty in a two-room council flat with his five siblings, his parents and a grandparent.  His father was a professional flyweight boxer, known as Battling Tom Smith, and a casual dockworker.  Brought up Catholic, he attended St Joseph's School, Paradise Street, Rotherhithe, and sang with his school choir at Westminster Cathedral.



Question: What is the Title of Max Bygraves autobiography?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the title of Max Bygraves' autobiography based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully to find any clues.

Looking at the context, I see that Max Bygraves, whose real name is Walter William Bygraves, is mentioned as an English comedian and variety performer. He hosted shows like Family Fortunes and appeared on TV. The context also talks about his early life, career, personal life, and some other details.

Now, focusing on the part about his autobiography. I remember that sometimes autobiographies are named after key events or notable works from a person's life. In the context, I see that in 1977, a UK publishing house released his comic novel titled "The Milkman's On His Way." That's a book, not an autobiography, but it's a work he wrote.

Wait, the question is about his autobiography. So, I need to check if there's any mention of an autobiography. Scanning through the text again, I don't see the exact title. However, I do see that he wrote a comic novel, which might be a different work. Maybe the autobiography is titled something else.

Alternatively, sometimes people name their autobiographies after significant moments or titles related to their career. Since he was a comedian and variety performer, perhaps the title is something like "My Life in Showbiz" or similar. But I don't recall seeing that in the context.

Wait, the context mentions that he changed his name to Max Bygraves in honor of comedian Max Miller. Maybe the autobiography reflects on his journey or career, but without the exact title, I might have to infer.

Wait, the context says he wrote "The Milkman's On His Way," which is a novel, but not an autobiography. So perhaps the autobiography is another work. Alternatively, maybe the title is "My Story" or something generic, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the title is mentioned elsewhere. Let me check again. The context mentions that he was the subject of "This Is Your Life" in 1961, but that's a TV show, not an autobiography.

Hmm, I'm not finding the exact title in the provided context. Maybe the answer is that the title isn't provided in the context, but the user is asking based on the context. Alternatively, perhaps the title is "The Milkman's On His Way," but that's a novel, not an autobiography.

Wait, the user is asking specifically about the autobiography. Since the context doesn't mention the title of his autobiography, perhaps the answer is that the title isn't provided. But the user might be expecting me to infer it from the context.

Wait, another approach: sometimes people name their autobiographies after a significant work or event. Since he wrote a novel called "The Milkman's On His Way," maybe his autobiography is titled similarly, but with "Autobi ['i wanna tell you story']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Vilnius (; Polish: Wilno, see also other names) is the capital of Lithuania and its largest city, with a population of 542,664 . Vilnius is located in the southeast part of Lithuania and is the second largest city in the Baltic states.

During Russian rule, the city walls were destroyed, and, by 1805, only the Gate of Dawn remained. In 1812, the city was taken by Napoleon on his push towards Moscow, and



Question: A Varsovian is a native of which capital city?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what a Varsovian is a native of. The question is asking about the capital city where Varsovians are from. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the context provided talks about Vilnius, which is the capital of Lithuania. It mentions that Vilnius is the largest city in Lithuania with a population of over half a million. It also describes Vilnius as the seat of the main government institutions and the Vilnius District Municipality. Additionally, it notes that Vilnius was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which once included a large area covering parts of modern-day Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, etc.

The term "Varsovian" isn't directly defined in the context, but I recall from general knowledge that "Warsawian" or "Varsovian" refers to someone from Warsaw. However, in the given context, the focus is on Vilnius, not Warsaw. So I need to reconcile this.

Wait, the context doesn't mention Warsaw at all. It's all about Vilnius. So perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. Since the context is about Vilnius, maybe the answer is related to that. But the term "Varsovian" usually refers to someone from Warsaw, which is the capital of Poland.

Hmm, but in the context provided, the only capital mentioned is Vilnius. So if the question is based on the given context, which doesn't mention Warsaw, then perhaps the answer is Vilnius. But that might be confusing because "Varsovian" typically refers to Warsaw.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking about a "Varsovian," which is a term I'm familiar with meaning someone from Warsaw. But in the given context, the capital is Vilnius. So perhaps the answer is that a Varsovian is a native of Warsaw, but since the context doesn't mention Warsaw, maybe the answer isn't directly in the context.

Wait, no, the context is about Vilnius, so perhaps the answer is Vilnius. But that doesn't make sense because Varsovian is from Warsaw. Maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Vilnius, but that's conflicting with my prior knowledge.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge that Varsovian refers to Vilnius, but that's incorrect. No, Varsovian is definitely from Warsaw. So maybe the answer is Warsaw, but the context doesn't mention it. So perhaps the answer isn't in the context, but the question is based on the context, so maybe the answer is Vilnius.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The context says Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania. The question is about a Varsovian, which I know is someone from Warsaw. But since the ['varsovie', 'varshava', 'capital of poland', 'warszawa poland', 'warwaw', 'warschau', 'city of warsaw', 'varshe', 'var≈°uva', 'warszowa', 'war≈°awa', 'warszawianka courts', 'boroughs of warsaw', 'wa wa', 'warsaw invasion', 'warsaw poland', 'warszewa', 'un locode plwaw', 'warszawa', 'warsawa', 'warshaw', 'varsovian', 'warsaw', 'warsaw city poland', 'plwaw']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "You're the One That I Want" is a song written by John Farrar for the 1978 film version of the musical Grease. It was performed by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. It is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 3 million copies among the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France alone, with estimates of more than 15 million copies sold overall.    

Chart history

In 1993, Epic Records released the London cast recording, Grease - Original London Cast Recording, and "You're the One That I Want" was issued as the lead single by Craig McLachlan and Deborah Gibson (Epic UK 659 522, released July 1993). In part due to a routine promotional push and huge box office success of the first major revival of Grease, this cover version scored big on the UK singles charts, peaking at number thirteen.

The song serves as the source of the title of the American reality TV show Grease: You're the One that I Want!. This gritty rockabilly version replaced the original second-to-last song in its Broadway run, "All Choked Up," for the Broadway revival it would then give rise to, with its two winners, Max Crumm and Laura Osnes.

In 2012, a cover version by Angus & Julia Stone was used in commercials for Sky (UK and Ireland).

In 1996, the song was covered for the Greased EP by Less Than Jake.

In 2001 or 2003, the song appeared on Bob the Builder: The Album.

In October 2004 a version recorded by British sophisti-pop band The Beautiful South was used as the first track on their album of cover songs, Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs.

British comedians Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker also released a version of the song in 1978. This version is perhaps best remembered for an infamously bad live performance on the TV show Top of the Pops; both Mullard and Baker sang out of tune, fluffed the lyrics and seemed utterly bemused. Their version reached No. 22 in the UK.



Question: Who had a 1992 hit with You're The One for Me Fatty?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who had a 1992 hit with "You're The One for Me Fatty." Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context talks about various cover versions of the song "You're the One That I Want." It mentions that in 1993, a cover by Craig McLachlan and Deborah Gibson was released, peaking at number thirteen in the UK. Then, it goes on to mention other covers, like one by The Beautiful South in 2004 and Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker in 1978, but that was a bad performance.

Wait, the question is about a 1992 hit with "You're The One for Me Fatty." Hmm, the song title in the context is "You're the One That I Want," but the question refers to "You're The One for Me Fatty." Maybe it's a typo or a different version. Let me think. The context doesn't explicitly mention "You're The One for Me Fatty," but it does talk about various artists covering "You're the One That I Want." 

Wait, the context does mention that in 1996, the song was covered for the Greased EP by Less Than Jake. But that's 1996, not 1992. Then, in 1993, the London cast recording was released. The question is about 1992, so maybe it's referring to another artist. 

Wait, the context also mentions that in 1993, Craig McLachlan and Deborah Gibson had a UK single. But that's 1993, not 1992. The question is about 1992. Let me check if any other artists covered the song around that time. 

Wait, the context doesn't mention any 1992 releases. It starts talking about 1993. So maybe the answer is that there's no mention of a 1992 hit in the context provided. But the question is asking who had a 1992 hit with that song. 

Wait, perhaps the song "You're The One for Me Fatty" is a different version or a typo. Maybe it's a misprint, and the intended song is "You're the One That I Want." If that's the case, then looking at the context, the 1993 UK single by Craig McLachlan and Deborah Gibson was the cover. But that's 1993, not 1992. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different artist. Let me think. The Beautiful South covered it in 2004, but that's later. Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker in 1978, but that's earlier. 

Wait, the context mentions that in 1996, Less Than Jake covered it. So 1996. But the question is about 1992. So perhaps the answer is that no one with a 1992 ['morrisey', 'steven morrissey', 'morissey', 'morrissey', 'steven patrick morrissey', 'stephen patrick morrissey', 'morrissy', 'steven morissey', 'mozzer', 'tina dehgani', 'stephen morrissey', 'jake walters']

Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five (Amersham, Chalfont & Latimer, Chesham, and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line, and Epping on the Central line), are beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway. Of the 32 London boroughs, six (Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton) are not served by the Underground network, while Hackney has Old Street and Manor House only just inside its boundaries. Lewisham used to beserved by the East London Line (stations at New Cross and New Cross Gate). The line and the stations were transferred to the London Overground  network in 2010

London Underground's eleven lines total 402 km in length, making it the third longest metro system in the world. These are made up of the sub-surface network and the deep-tube lines.  The Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines form the sub-surface network, with railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share stations and most of their track with each other, as well as with the

Originally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift. Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts. The escalators had a

The world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863, is now part of the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line. The network has expanded to 11 lines, and in 2015‚Äì16 carried 1.34 billion passengers, making it the world's 11th busiest metro system.

world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground "inner circle" connecting



Question: What alphabetically is the first station on the London underground?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the alphabetically first station on the London Underground based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully to find all the station names mentioned.

The context mentions several stations: Amersham, Chalfont & Latimer, Chesham, Chorleywood, Epping, Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham, Sutton, Hackney, Manor House, New Cross, New Cross Gate, and Earl's Court. Wait, I should list all of them to make sure I don't miss any.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: After almost 31 years of service, she was sunk on 2 May 1982 during the Falklands War () by the Royal Navy submarine  with the loss of 323 lives. Losses from General Belgrano totalled just over half of Argentine military deaths in the war.

By 29 April the ships were patrolling the Burdwood Bank, south of the islands. On 30 April General Belgrano was detected by the British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine . The submarine approached over the following day. On 1 May 1982, Admiral Juan Lombardo ordered all Argentine naval units to seek out the British task force around the Falklands and launch a ‚Äúmassive attack‚Äù the following day. General Belgrano, which was outside and to the south-west of the exclusion zone, was orderedsouth-east.

She is the only ship ever to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine  and the second sunk in action by any type of submarine since World War II, the first being the Indian frigate  by the Pakistani Submarine  during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War.  The sinking of General Belgrano was highly controversial in both the United Kingdom and Argentina at the time and remains so to this day.

Early career

At no time during the Falklands conflict did either the United Kingdom or Argentina declare war against the other country. Combat was confined to the area around and on the islands themselves. General Belgrano was sunk outside the 200 nmi total exclusion zone around the Falklands, delimited by the UK. Through a message passed via the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires to the Argentine government on 23 April, the UK made clear that it no longer considered the 200-mile (370¬†km) exclusion zone as thelimit of its military action. The message read:

Following the loss of General Belgrano, the Argentinian fleet returned to its bases and played no major role in the rest of the conflict. British nuclear submarines continued to operate in the sea areas between Argentina and the Falkland Islands, gathering intelligence, providing early warning of air raids and posing a considerable threat in being.  A further effect was that the Argentinian Navy's carrier-borne aircraft had to operate from land bases at the limit of their range, rather thanfrom an aircraft carrier at sea.  The minimal role of the Navy in the rest of the campaign led to a considerable loss of credibility and influence within the Junta.Controversy over the sinking



Question: Which British submarine sank the General Belgrano in the Falklands War?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which British submarine sank the General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Falklands War. It was between Argentina and the UK, primarily over the Falkland Islands. The conflict lasted from April to June 1982.

From the context provided, the General Belgrano was an Argentine cruiser that was sunk. The question is specifically about the British submarine responsible for her sinking. I remember that the sinking of the Belgrano was a significant event and quite controversial.

Looking at the context, it mentions that the submarine involved was a Royal Navy submarine. The passage states, "She is the only ship ever to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine and the second sunk in action by any type of submarine since World War II..." It also mentions that the submarine was a nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine.

Wait, the context says that the submarine was detected by the British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine. So, the submarine that detected her was part of the British task force. But the actual sinking happened when the submarine approached and fired, leading to the loss of General Belgrano.

The context also mentions that the submarine was ordered south-east after detection. The key point is that the submarine was a nuclear-powered one, and it was the only one to sink a ship in that way since WWII.

So, putting it together, the British submarine responsible was a nuclear-powered hunter-killer. The passage doesn't name the specific submarine, but it refers to it as the "British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine." However, in the context, the submarine is described as having been involved in the sinking, and it's noted that it was the only such submarine to sink a ship in that manner since WWII.

Wait, the context also mentions that the submarine was detected by the British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine. So, the submarine that detected her was part of the task force, but the actual sinking was done by another submarine? Or was it the same one?

Wait, no, the context says that on 30 April, General Belgrano was detected by the British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine. Then, the submarine approached over the following day. On 1 May, the Argentine admiral ordered a massive attack, but General Belgrano was ordered south-east. She was sunk by the British submarine.

Wait, the context says, "On 1 May 1982, Admiral Juan Lombardo ordered all Argentine naval units to seek out the British task force around the Falklands and launch a ‚Äúmassive attack‚Äù the following day. General Belgrano, which was outside and to the south-west of the exclusion zone, was ordered south-east."

Then, the passage continues, "She is the only ship ever to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine and the second sunk in action by any type of submarine since World ['hms conqueror']

Country Dick Montana recorded it with the Pleasure Barons as part of a Tom Jones medley on their live album Pleasure Barons Live in Las Vegas.  It was covered in 1978 by Filipino singer/artist [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?pagegr&GRid

"Delilah" is a murder ballad recorded by Welsh singer Tom Jones in 1968. The lyrics were written by Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham Mason, to music by Les Reed, who also contributed the title and theme of the song. It earned Reed and Mason the 1968 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

Success

Jones narrates the song as a betrayed lover who spies his woman in silhouette on a window blind as she makes love to another man.  Although he realizes that she is no good for him, he becomes temporarily insane. Waiting until her paramour leaves, at the break of day, he knocks on the door, which she opens, only to laugh in his face. He stabs her to death. Realizing this murderous act, the betrayed lover begs her forgiveness before the police come to break down the door and take him away.Jones' version features a big-band accompaniment set to a flamenco rhythm. The pitch of the final note is A4.

Cover versions

In the episode of The Simpsons, "Homer the Heretic", Homer sings the chorus while showering, seemingly pleased with himself for getting out of going to church.

In the 14th episode of Raising Hope, "What Up, Cuz?", the song appears in a flashback showing the young Virginia Chance with her cousin Delilah.

In the first episode of the 2012 British comedy series Citizen Khan, Mr Khan sings the song over the mosque speakers much to the amusement of several fellow worshippers.

MusicAccording to Philip Norman's biography of Elton John, the future pop superstar provided background vocals on this song.

On 4 June 2012 Jones performed the song for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert.

Prior to the 2016 Six Nations Championship rugby tournament, Welsh MP Chris Bryant requested that the song not be sung by Welsh rugby fans as the lyrics glorifies violence towards women.

Question: What was singer Jack Jones father Allan's theme song?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the theme song of Jack Jones' father, Allan, was. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context talks about "Delilah," a song recorded by Tom Jones in 1968. It mentions that Tom Jones narrates the story of a betrayed lover who kills his woman. The song was written by Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham Mason, with music by Les Reed. It also notes that Les Reed and Mason won an Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

Now, the question is about Jack Jones' father, Allan. I know that Jack Jones is a singer, and his father's name is Allan. The context doesn't directly mention Allan's theme song, but it does talk about Tom Jones, who is a different person. Wait, no, actually, the context is about "Delilah" by Tom Jones, not Jack Jones. So maybe I'm mixing up the names here.

Wait, the question is about Jack Jones' father, Allan. So perhaps the context is referring to Tom Jones, but the question is about Jack Jones. I need to find out what Allan's theme song was. Since the context doesn't mention Allan, I might need to think of other ways. Maybe the song "Delilah" is associated with Tom Jones, but not with Allan. Alternatively, perhaps the context is a red herring, and the answer is elsewhere.

Wait, the context mentions that Tom Jones recorded "Delilah," but the question is about Jack Jones' father, Allan. Maybe the answer is that Allan's theme song is "Delilah," but that doesn't make sense because "Delilah" is by Tom Jones. Alternatively, perhaps the context is referring to Jack Jones, but the question is about his father. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the context says that Tom Jones recorded "Delilah," but the question is about Jack Jones' father, Allan. Maybe the answer is that Allan's theme song is "Delilah," but that doesn't fit because Tom Jones is the one who sang it. Alternatively, perhaps the context is a distraction, and the answer is that the theme song is "Delilah," but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the context is about Tom Jones, and the question is about Jack Jones. Maybe the answer is that Jack Jones' father's theme song is "Delilah," but that doesn't make sense because Tom Jones is a different person. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the theme song is "Delilah," but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. The context is about "Delilah" by Tom Jones, but the question is about Jack Jones' father, Allan. Since the context doesn't mention Allan, perhaps the answer is that his theme song is "Delil ['donkey serenade']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: ice I (spoken as "ice one h") with minute traces of cubic ice denoted as ice I. The most common phase transition to ice I occurs when liquid water is cooled below  (, ) at standard atmospheric pressure. It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost. The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.Ice is used in a variety of ways, including cooling, winter sports and ice sculpture.

Characteristics

In outer space, hexagonal crystalline ice (the predominant form found on Earth) is extremely rare. Amorphous ice is more common; however, hexagonal crystalline ice can be formed by volcanic action. 

Other ices

The solid phases of several other volatile substances are also referred to as ices; generally a volatile is classed as an ice if its melting point lies above or around 100 K. The best known example is dry ice, the solid form of carbon dioxide.

Ice molecules can exhibit up to sixteen different phases (packing geometries) that depend on temperature and pressure. When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three different types of amorphous ice can form depending on the history of its pressure and temperature. When cooled slowly correlated proton tunneling occurs below 20 K giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena. Virtually all the ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as

Question: What is the more common name for atmospheric vapour frozen in a crystalline form?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "What is the more common name for atmospheric vapour frozen in a crystalline form?" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The context talks about various types of ice, including hexagonal crystalline ice, which is the predominant form found on Earth. It mentions that this type of ice is formed by volcanic action and is the most common. The context also refers to other ices, like dry ice, which is carbon dioxide's solid form, but that's not relevant here.

The question is about atmospheric vapor frozen into a crystalline form. So, I'm thinking about what happens when water vapor freezes in the atmosphere. From what I remember, when water vapor freezes, it forms ice crystals. These ice crystals are what we commonly think of as snow or ice in the sky.

Looking at the context again, it mentions that hexagonal crystalline ice is the predominant form on Earth. So, when atmospheric vapor freezes, it's likely forming this hexagonal crystalline ice. The context also mentions that this is the form found on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere, so it's the most common.

I don't see any other types of ice mentioned in the context that would be more common than hexagonal crystalline ice for atmospheric vapor. So, putting it all together, the more common name for atmospheric vapor frozen into a crystalline form is hexagonal crystalline ice.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Prussian Patent No. 19 was granted to Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Johann Gottfried Moritz (1777‚Äì1840)  on September 12, 1835 for a "basstuba" in F1. The original Wieprecht and Moritz instrument used five valves of the Berlinerpumpen type that were the forerunners of the modern piston valve. The first tenor tuba was invented in 1838 by Carl Wilhelm Moritz (1810‚Äì1855), son of Johann Gottfried Moritz.

Adolphe Sax, like Wieprecht, was interested in marketing systems of instruments from soprano to bass, and developed a series of brass instruments known as saxhorns. The instruments developed by Sax were generally pitched in E and B, while the Wieprecht "basstuba" and the subsequent Cerveny contrabass tuba were pitched in F and C (see below on pitch systems). Sax's instruments gained dominance in France, and later in Britain and America, as a result of the popularity and movements of instrument

Tubas are made with either piston or rotary valves. Rotary valves, invented by Joseph Riedl, are based on a design included in the original valve patents by Friedrich Bl√ºhmel and Heinrich St√∂lzel in 1818. ƒåerveny of Graslitz was the first to use true rotary valves, starting in the 1840s or 1850s. Modern piston valves were developed by Fran√ßois P√©rinet for the saxhorn family of instruments promoted by Adolphe Sax around the same time. Pistons may either be oriented to point to the top of the

Larger BBB subcontrabass tubas exist, but are extremely rare (there are at least four known examples). The first two were built by Gustave Besson in BBB, one octave below the BB Contrabass tuba, on the suggestion of John Philip Sousa. The monster instruments were not completed until just after Sousa's death. Later, in the 1950s, British musician Gerard Hoffnung commissioned the London firm of Paxman to create a subcontrabass tuba in EEE for use in his comedic music festivals. Also, a tuba

modern sousaphone, named after American bandmaster John Philip Sousa, resembles a h√©licon with the bell pointed up (in the original models as the J. W. Pepper prototype and Sousa's concert instruments) and then curved to point forward (as developed by Conn and others). Some ancestors of the tuba, such as the military bombardon, had unusual valve and bore arrangements compared to modern tubas. During the American Civil War, most brass bands used a branch of the brass family known as saxhorns,



Question: Which musical instrument was patented in Berlin by Freidrich Buschmann in 1822?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which musical instrument was patented in Berlin by Friedrich Buschmann in 1822. Let me start by going through the context provided.

The context mentions several inventors and their contributions to musical instruments. It starts with Prussian Patent No. 19 granted to Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Johann Gottfried Moritz in 1835 for a "basstuba" in F1. They used five valves of the Berlinerpumpen type, which are predecessors to the modern piston valve. Then it mentions Carl Wilhelm Moritz, who invented the first tenor tuba in 1838. 

Next, it talks about Adolphe Sax developing saxhorns, which were pitched in E and B, while Wieprecht's "basstuba" and Cerveny's contrabass tuba were pitched in F and C. It also discusses the types of valves‚Äîpiston and rotary. Piston valves were developed by Fran√ßois P√©rinet for saxhorns, while rotary valves were based on patents by Friedrich Bl√ºhmel and Heinrich St√∂lzel in 1818, first used by ƒåerveny in the 1840s or 1850s.

Then, it mentions larger BBB subcontrabass tubas built by Gustave Besson, commissioned by John Philip Sousa, and a sousaphone resembling a h√©licon, which was later developed by Conn. It also notes that some ancestors of the tuba, like the military bombardon, had unusual valve arrangements.

Now, the question is about the instrument patented in Berlin by Friedrich Buschmann in 1822. Looking through the context, I see that the first mention is of Prussian Patent No. 19 in 1835, granted to Wieprecht and Moritz. But Buschmann is a different name. I don't see Buschmann mentioned in the context provided. The context talks about several inventors but doesn't mention Buschmann. 

Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me read again. The context starts with Wieprecht and Moritz, then moves on to Sax, then valve types, then Cerveny, then Besson, Sousa, Hoffnung, sousaphone, bombardon. No mention of Buschmann. So, if Buschmann is not mentioned, maybe the answer isn't in the context. But the question is based on the context provided, so perhaps the answer isn't there, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the context mentions that the original Wieprecht and Moritz instrument used five valves of the Berlinerpumpen type, which were the forerunners of the modern piston valve. Then it mentions that Fran√ßois P√©rinet developed piston valves for saxhorns. But Buschmann is not mentioned. So, perhaps the answer isn't in the context, but the question is prompting me to infer based on ['accordions', 'fisarmonica', 'accordion', 'aeoline', 'akkordeon', 'accordian', 'accordeon', 'accordionist']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: She began appearing on stage, playing the title role in the 1980 British revival of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney, and later had a lead role in the 1990 revival of No√´l Coward's Private Lives. In 1981, she landed the role of Alexis Carrington Colby, the vengeful ex-wife of John Forsythe's character, in the 1980s television soap opera Dynasty, winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 1982; she is credited for the success around Dynasty, which was the most-watched television show in Americaduring the 1984-85 broadcast season. Collins also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983 for career achievement.

Dame Joan Henrietta Collins, DBE (born 23 May 1933) is an English actress, author and columnist. Born in Paddington, west London, and brought up in Maida Vale, Collins grew up during the Second World War. After making her stage debut in A Doll's House at the age of nine, she trained as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. She then signed an exclusive contract with the Rank Organisation and appeared in various British films.

At the age of 17, Collins was signed to the J. Arthur Rank Film Company, a British film studio.[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid

Films

On 24 January 2010, it was announced that Collins was joining the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love) for a short run. She played an aristocratic British woman, Lady Joan, who takes a young prince, portrayed by German actor Stephan Kaefer (Stephan K√§fer), in tow. Collins started shooting on 22 February 2010 and appeared on-screen in April 2010.

In 1985, Dynasty was the no.¬†1 show in the United States, beating out Dallas, which ranked at no.¬†2.  For her portrayal of Alexis, Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award (every year from 1982 to 1987), winning once in 1983, the same year she was nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series.  Upon accepting the award, Collins thanked Sophia Loren for turning down the part of Alexis.  At the age of 50, Collins appeared in a 12-page photo layout for Playboy magazineshot by George Hurrell.



Question: Which celebrity first found fame as the Joan Collins Fan Club?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which celebrity first found fame as the Joan Collins Fan Club. Let me start by reading the context provided.

The context talks about Dame Joan Henrietta Collins, DBE, an English actress, author, and columnist. She was born in 1933 and started her acting career at a young age. She appeared in various British films after training at RADA. She also had roles in TV shows like Dynasty, where she played Alexis Carrington Colby. She won a Golden Globe for that role and was a big success.

The question is asking which celebrity first found fame as the Joan Collins Fan Club. Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Is it referring to a fan club or a character name? Because Joan Collins is the actress's name, but in the context, she's the person being discussed.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to a fan club named after her, but the context doesn't mention her having a fan club. It mentions her roles and awards but not a fan club. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misphrased, and it's actually referring to her role as Alexis Carrington Colby in Dynasty, which might be the source of her fame.

Wait, the context says she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in 1982 for Dynasty, and it was the most-watched show in the US during 1984-85. So her fame came from Dynasty, not a fan club. So maybe the question is trying to say which celebrity first found fame through a role, but the wording is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a fan club named after her, but the context doesn't mention that. So maybe the answer is that she herself is the celebrity, and she found fame through her roles, not a fan club.

Wait, the question is specifically about the Joan Collins Fan Club. Since the context doesn't mention a fan club, perhaps the answer is that she didn't have a fan club but found fame through her acting. But the question is about the fan club, so maybe the answer is that she didn't have a fan club but became famous through her role as Alexis Carrington.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is that she is the one who found fame, not a fan club. So the answer would be Joan Collins herself, as she is the celebrity in question.

Wait, but the question is about the Joan Collins Fan Club. Since the context doesn't mention a fan club, maybe the answer is that she didn't have a fan club but became famous through her acting. But the question is specifically about the fan club, so perhaps the answer is that she didn't have a fan club but found fame through her role.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, and the answer is that she is the one who found fame, not a fan club. So the answer would be Joan Collins.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Some parts of the contiguous United States are accessible by road only by traveling on Canadian soil. Point Roberts, Washington; Elm Point, Minnesota; and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota are three such places. Alburgh, Vermont, is not directly connected by land, but is accessible by road via bridges from New York and Vermont. 

List of contiguous U.S. states 

The 48 contiguous United States are:Washington, D.C. (the U.S. capital, also referred to as the District of Columbia) is not to be confused with the state of Washington.

The term "Lower 48" is also used to refer to the conterminous United States. The National Geographic style guide recommends the use of contiguous or conterminous United States instead of lower 48 when the 48 states are meant, unless used in the context of Alaska.  

Terms used in the non-contiguous states 

Both Alaskans and Hawaiians have unique labels for the contiguous United States because of their own locations relative to them.

Alaska

Because Alaska is also on the North American continent, the term continental United States would also include that state, so the term is sometimes qualified with the explicit inclusion or exclusion of Alaska to resolve any ambiguity.     The term was in use prior to the admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states of the United States and at that time usually excluded outlying territories of the United States.    However, even before Alaska became a state, it was sometimes included within the"Continental U.S."

Hawaii 

Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States on August 21, 1959. It is the southernmost and so far, the latest state to join the Union. Not part of any continent, Hawaii is located in the Pacific Ocean, about  from North America and almost halfway to Asia. In Hawaii and overseas American territories, for instance, the terms the Mainland  or U.S. Mainland are often used to refer to the continental United States. 

Non-contiguous areas within the contiguous United States

The contiguous United States consists of the 48 adjoining U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. (federal district), on the continent of North America.   The term excludes the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii and all off-shore United States territories and possessions, which include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.



Question: Which cardinal point does not appear in the names of the American states?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which cardinal point doesn't appear in the names of the American states. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The context talks about the contiguous United States, mentioning several states like Washington, Minnesota, Vermont, etc. It also mentions that Alaska and Hawaii are non-contiguous, but the focus is on the 48 states.

I should list out the states mentioned and see their cardinal directions in their names. The states given in the context are Washington, D.C. (though it's a district, not a state), Washington (state), Minnesota, Vermont, and others like that. Wait, the context actually lists specific points like Point Roberts, Washington; Elm Point, Minnesota; and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota. Also, Alburgh, Vermont is mentioned.

Wait, the question is about the names of the American states, not the points within them. So I need to look at the names of the states themselves. Let me list the states mentioned:

- Washington (state)
- Minnesota
- Vermont
- The Northwest Angle (part of Minnesota)
- Point Roberts, Washington (but that's a point, not a state)
- Alburgh, Vermont

Wait, the context also mentions the term "Lower 48" referring to the contiguous U.S. states, which are 48 in total. The states are Washington, D.C. (the capital), but Washington is a state as well. So the states are:

Looking at the list provided, the contiguous states are the 48, which include Washington, D.C. is a federal district, not a state. So the states are:

Alabama, Alaska (but Alaska is non-contiguous), Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (non-contiguous), Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

Wait, but the context says that the contiguous U.S. states are the 48, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. So the states are all except those two.

Now, looking at the names of these states, I need to check which cardinal directions are present in their names. Cardinal directions are North, South, East, West.

Let me go through each state name:

- Alabama: ends with "a", which is sometimes associated with West, but not directly a cardinal direction.
- Arizona: ends with "a", but "Arizona" doesn't have a cardinal direction.
- Arkansas: "Arkansas" doesn't have a cardinal direction.
- California: ends with "a", but no cardinal direction.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Channel Tunnel (; also nicknamed and shortened to Chunnel)   is a  rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France, beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. At its lowest point, it is 75 m deep.   At , the tunnel has the longest undersea portion of any tunnel in the world, although the Seikan Tunnel in Japan is both longer overall at  and deeper at 240 m below sea level. The speed limit in the tunnel is 160km/h.

fund with France for security surrounding the Port of Calais.  The UK Home Office stated that approximately 19,000 attempts to cross the Channel during the first half of 2015 had been detected and prevented.

Both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts that led to the construction of the tunnel were overestimated; in particular, Eurotunnel's commissioned forecasts were over-predictions. Although the captured share of Channel crossings was forecast correctly, high competition (especially from budget airlines which expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s) and reduced tariffs led to low revenue. Overall cross-Channel traffic was overestimated.

The Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and Castle Hill landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964‚Äì65 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending 80 m below the seabed, 500 m south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip,

Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802,  but British political and press pressure over the compromising of national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. An early attempt at building a Channel Tunnel was made in the late 19th century, on the English side "in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government".  The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994.  At ¬£4.65 billion, the project came in 80%



Question: What is the shortest Channel crossing time via the Channel Tunnel?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the shortest Channel crossing time via the Channel Tunnel. Let me start by reading the context provided.

The context mentions that the tunnel has a speed limit of 160 km/h. That's a key point because speed directly affects crossing time. So, if I can determine the length of the tunnel, I can use the speed to calculate the time.

Wait, the context also says that the tunnel is the longest undersea portion in the world, but it's beaten by the Seikan Tunnel in Japan in terms of overall length and depth. However, the exact length of the Channel Tunnel isn't provided here. Hmm, maybe I can infer it from other information.

I recall that the Channel Tunnel is about 50 km long, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The context mentions that the tunnel's undersea portion is the longest, but it doesn't give the exact figure. Wait, the speed limit is 160 km/h, so if the tunnel is, say, 50 km, then the time would be distance divided by speed.

So, time = distance / speed. If the tunnel is 50 km, then time would be 50 km / 160 km/h. Let me calculate that. 50 divided by 160 is 0.3125 hours. Converting that to minutes, 0.3125 * 60 = 18.75 minutes. So approximately 19 minutes.

But wait, the context doesn't specify the exact length of the tunnel. Maybe I should look for any clues. The context mentions that the tunnel's route was adjusted due to geological issues, but it doesn't give the length. Alternatively, perhaps the speed limit is 160 km/h, so regardless of the tunnel's length, the time would be based on that speed.

Wait, the question is about the shortest crossing time via the tunnel. So, the time is determined by the speed limit and the tunnel's length. Since the tunnel's length isn't specified, maybe I can infer it from general knowledge. The Channel Tunnel is about 50.9 km long. So, using that, time would be 50.9 / 160 = 0.319 hours, which is about 19.14 minutes.

But since the context doesn't provide the exact length, perhaps the answer is based on the speed limit. Alternatively, maybe the tunnel's length is given elsewhere. Wait, the context says the tunnel has the longest undersea portion, but the Seikan Tunnel is longer overall. So, the Channel Tunnel's undersea part is the longest, but the total length isn't specified here.

Wait, the context mentions that the tunnel's speed limit is 160 km/h, so the time would be the tunnel's length divided by that speed. Since the tunnel's length isn't provided, perhaps the answer is based on the speed limit alone, but that ['dover to calais']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Duke of Wellington is a hereditary title of the senior rank in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It derived from Wellington in Somerset, and was created for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington (born The Hon. Arthur Wesley) (1769‚Äì1852), the Anglo-Irish Army leader who is distinguished for leading the decisive victory with Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher over Napoleon Bonaparte's forces at Waterloo in Brabant (now Walloon Brabant, Belgiumand); Wellesley later served twice as British PrimeMinister. General references to "the Duke of Wellington" usually refer to Arthur Wellesley as the 1st Duke of Wellington, unless the context suggests a later date.

The titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess of Douro were bestowed upon  Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, on 11 May 1814 after he returned home a hero following Napoleon's abdication.  He fought some 60 battles in his military career, and never lost a single one. He was considered 'the conqueror of Napoleon'. He stands as one of the two finest soldiers Britain has ever produced, the other being the Duke of Marlborough.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are: Marquess of Wellington (1812), Marquess of Douro (1814), Earl of Mornington (1760 ‚Äì but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), Earl of Wellington (1812), Viscount Wellesley (1760 ‚Äì inherited in 1863), Viscount Wellington (1809), Baron Mornington (1746 ‚Äì also inherited in 1863), and Baron Douro (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage ofthe United Kingdom.

Apart from the British titles the Dukes of Wellington also hold the titles of Prince of Waterloo (Prins van Waterloo, 1815) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo, 1812) of the Kingdom of Spain, and Duke of Victoria (Duque da Vit√≥ria, 1812), with the subsidiary titles Marquess of Torres Vedras (Marqu√™s de Torres Vedras, 1812) and Count of Vimeiro (Conde de Vimeiro, 1811) of the Kingdom of Portugal. These were granted to the first Duke as victory

The family seat is Stratfield Saye House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. Apsley House, in London, is now owned by English Heritage, although the family retain an apartment there.

Question: What was the Duke of Wellington's name before he became a Duke?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "What was the Duke of Wellington's name before he became a Duke?" using the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully to find the relevant information.

The context starts by mentioning that the Duke of Wellington is a hereditary title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, derived from Wellington in Somerset. It then states that this title was created for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, who was born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Wait, that's interesting. His name before becoming a Duke might be Arthur Wesley or Arthur Wellesley.

Looking further, the context mentions that Arthur Wellesley was born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Then, after his military career and service as Prime Minister, he was created the 1st Duke of Wellington in 1814. So, before he became a Duke, his name was Arthur Wellesley, but he was born as Arthur Wesley. However, the title of Duke of Wellington was given to him, so his name before becoming a Duke would be Arthur Wellesley, but his birth name was Arthur Wesley.

Wait, but the question is about his name before becoming a Duke. So, when he was born, his name was Arthur Wesley, but he was later known as Arthur Wellesley. However, the title of Duke of Wellington was given to him, so perhaps his name before becoming a Duke was Arthur Wellesley, but that's the name he used after being elevated to the dukedom. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Arthur Wellesley was born as Arthur Wesley. He later changed his surname to Wellesley, possibly due to a family name change or some other reason. But in the context, it's stated that he was born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Then, after his military career, he was created the 1st Duke of Wellington. So, before becoming a Duke, his name was Arthur Wesley, but he later became Arthur Wellesley. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because Arthur Wellesley is his name after becoming a Duke.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The context says he was born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley, and later became Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. So, his name before becoming a Duke was Arthur Wesley, but he was later known as Arthur Wellesley. But the question is about his name before becoming a Duke, so it would be Arthur Wesley.

Wait, but the context also mentions that the titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess of Douro were bestowed upon Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, after his return. So, before becoming a Duke, he was the 1st Marquess of Wellington, but his name ['wellesley arthur', 'arthur wellesley', 'arthur wellesley disambiguation', 'arthur wellesley duke of wellington']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fourth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year with 210,000,000. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. Of the 53 stations served, 25 are below ground. Some of its stations are shared with the District line and some

*  opened 23 June 1903; closed 5 July 1931. Although on the route of the current Piccadilly line, a short distance north of the present , it was never served by Piccadilly line trains. It was opened by the District line, the original operator of the line between  and , and was closed and replaced by the present Park Royal station before the Piccadilly line started running trains to South Harrow in 1932.

History

The beginnings

The Piccadilly line began as the Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (GNP&BR), one of several railways controlled by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), whose chief director was Charles Tyson Yerkes, although he died before any of his schemes came to fruition.

*  opened on 30 November 1907 as the Strand tube station. It was at the end of a branch line from the main line at . An evening through-northbound 'Theatre' train ran until 1910. From 1917 onwards, it was served only by a shuttle from Holborn. In the same year it was renamed Aldwych when Charing Cross on the Northern line was renamed Strand. It was temporarily closed in 1940 during World War II to be used as an air-raid shelter. It re-opened in 1946. The possibility of extending the branch to

are shared with the Metropolitan line. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central line, and has the second most stations, after the District line. It serves many of London's top tourist attractions including Harrods (Knightsbridge), Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (within walking distance from Green Park), Piccadilly Circus (after which the line is named), Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe (based on passenger



Question: Which tube station stands at the northern end of the Piccadilly Line?
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which tube station is at the northern end of the Piccadilly Line. Let me start by going through the context provided.

The context mentions that the Piccadilly line is a part of the London Underground, colored dark blue. It's the fourth busiest line based on passengers, with 210 million per year. It runs from north to west London via Zone 1, with some surface sections, especially in the west. There are 53 stations, 25 of which are below ground. Some stations are shared with the District line, and others were opened earlier but replaced later.

Looking at the history section, the Piccadilly line started as the Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (GNP&BR). It was controlled by the UERL, and the line's name comes from Piccadilly Circus. The line was initially a main line, but during World War II, some stations were closed and replaced.

The question is about the northern end of the Piccadilly Line. From the context, the Piccadilly line runs from north to west London. So, the northern end would be the starting point from the north. 

In the history, it mentions that the Piccadilly line started running trains to South Harrow in 1932, replacing some stations. Before that, there was a station called Park Royal, which was opened in 1903 and closed in 1931. It was on the route of the current Piccadilly line but wasn't served by its trains. Instead, it was served by the District line.

Wait, the context also mentions that the Piccadilly line runs from the north to the west via Zone 1. So, the northern end would be the starting point from the north. The context doesn't explicitly name the northern station, but from the history, the original line was the GNP&BR, which might have had a specific station at the north end.

Alternatively, considering the current Piccadilly line, the northern stations are usually Finsbury Park and Arnosdale Road, but I'm not sure. Wait, the context says that the Piccadilly line is the fourth busiest, running from north to west, with some surface sections. It serves many tourist attractions like Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, etc.

Wait, the context also mentions that the Piccadilly line is the second longest after the Central line and has the second most stations after the District line. It serves places like Harrods, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden.

But the question is specifically about the northern end. From the history, the Piccadilly line started as the GNP&BR, which might have had a specific northern station. However, the context doesn't explicitly name it. Wait, the context says that the Piccadilly line runs from the north to the west via Zone ['trent school cockfosters', 'trent c of e primary school', 'cockfosters', 'cockfosters london england']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Some collectors are generalists with very broad criteria for inclusion, while others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others‚Äîcalled completists‚Äîaim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek a limited number of items per category (e.g. one representative item per year of manufacture or place of purchase).

Collecting is a practice with a very old cultural history. The Egyptian Ptolemaic dynasty collected books from all over the known world at the Library of Alexandria. The Medici family, in Renaissance Florence, made the first effort to collect art by private patronage, this way artists could be free for the first time from the money given by the Church and Kings; this citizenship tradition continues today with the work of private art collectors. Many of the world's popular museums‚Äîfrom the

The most obvious way to categorise collections is by the type of objects collected. Most collections are of manufactured commercial items, but natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies, rocks, and seashells can also be the subject of a collection. Among collections of manufactured items, the objects may be antique, or simply collectible. Antiques are collectible items at least 100 years old, while collectibles can be arbitrarily recent. Collectors and dealers may use the word vintage to

The collecting hobby is a modern descendant of the "cabinet of curiosities" which was common among scholars with the means and opportunities to acquire unusual items from the 16th century onwards. Planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back at least to George Thomason in the reign of Charles I and Samuel Pepys in that of Charles II. Collecting engravings and other prints by those whose means did not allow them to buy original works of art also goes back many centuries. The progress

The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: "If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them."



Question: What 'B' is a collector of rare books? A. A bookseller B. A librarian C. A publisher D. A. A bookseller
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which option is the correct answer for the question: "What 'B' is a collector of rare books? A. A bookseller B. A librarian C. A publisher D. A. A bookseller." Wait, the options seem a bit confusing. Let me read the context again to make sure I understand.

The context provided talks about the history of collecting, mentioning the Egyptian Ptolemaic dynasty collecting books for the Library of Alexandria, the Medici family collecting art, and how museums today have collections. It also mentions that collecting can involve various types of objects, including rare books. The question is specifically asking about what 'B' is, and the options are A. A bookseller, B. A librarian, C. A publisher, D. A. A bookseller. Hmm, that last option seems redundant because D is repeating A.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A. A bookseller, B. A librarian, C. A publisher, D. A. A bookseller. So, D is the same as A. That might be a typo, but I'll proceed.

The question is about who 'B' is, which is a collector of rare books. From the context, it's mentioned that the Medici family collected art, and many museums have collections. But specifically, the context also talks about the Library of Alexandria, which was a collection of books. However, the question is about a collector, not a library.

In the context, it's mentioned that planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back to George Thomason and Samuel Pepys. Collectors and dealers may use the word vintage, but that's about manufactured items. The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items. So, a collector is someone who does these things.

Now, looking at the options: A is a bookseller, which is someone who sells books, not necessarily a collector. B is a librarian, who works in a library, managing and organizing books. But a librarian is more about curating and preserving books for public access, not necessarily collecting them as a personal hobby or passion. C is a publisher, which is someone who publishes books, not a collector. D is again a bookseller.

Wait, but the context also mentions that the Medici family used private patronage to collect art, freeing artists from Church and King money. That's about collecting art, but the question is about rare books. So, perhaps the answer is a bookseller, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is a librarian because they manage rare books, but the question is about a collector.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "Song Sung Blue" is a 1972 hit song written and recorded by Neil Diamond, inspired by the second movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto #21.  The song was released on Diamond's album, Moods and later appeared on many of Diamond's live and compilation albums.

"Song Sung Blue" was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1973, Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Both awards that year were won by Roberta Flack's rendition of Ewan MacColl's song, "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face".

Diamond described "Song Sung Blue" in the liner notes to his 1996 compilation album, In My Lifetime, as a "very basic message, unadorned. I didn't even write a bridge to it. I never expected anyone to react to "Song Sung Blue" the way they did. I just like it, the message and the way a few words said so many things."

The song inspired the title of a 2008 documentary about a Neil Diamond impersonator who was married to a Patsy Cline impersonator. 

Cover versions

It was his second No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, after 1970's "Cracklin' Rosie".  The song spent twelve weeks in the Top 40. In addition, "Song Sung Blue" spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart.  In addition, the song made the pop chart in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.  The song has become one of Diamond's standards, and he often performs this song during concerts.

Andy Williams released a version in 1972 on his album, Alone Again (Naturally).

Sacha Distel recorded the song in French as "Chanson Bleue".

British pop group Altered Images released a version in 1982 on album Pinky Blue.

Bobby Darin performed the song in 1972 during his summer television show, and his version was included on the 2004 album, Aces Back to Back.

Frank Sinatra also recorded a version in his "Trilogy" Album.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duo‚Äîthe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stooge‚Äîis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other one‚Äîthe funny man, banana man or comic‚Äîis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent,

Morecambe and Wise are arguably the quintessential British double act. They followed the traditional formula with Eric Morecambe as the comic and Ernie Wise as the feed. However, other British acts such as The Two Ronnies, Hale and Pace, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, Reeves and Mortimer, French and Saunders, Mitchell and Webb, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, Fry and Laurie, Lee and Herring, Armstrong and Miller, Peacock and Gamble, the role of "comic" and "straight man" are less obvious,

In Britain, double acts would remain confined to theatres and radio until the late 1950s, when double acts such as Morecambe and Wise and Mike and Bernie Winters slowly began the transition to television on variety programmes such as Sunday Night at the London Palladium. It was not until the mid to late 1960s that these acts truly came into their own. When Morecambe and Wise teamed up with writer Eddie Braben, they began to redefine what was meant by a double act, with Wise, the straight man,

being developed into a comic character in his own right. They provided the link between music hall and modern comedy for double acts.The Story Of Light Entertainment: Double Acts, BBC 2, 9pm, 22 July 2006 As the two leading double acts of the day, Morecambe and Wise and the Winters brothers enjoyed a playful rivalry‚Äîthe Winters themselves mocked the slight edge Morecambe and Wise had over them in popularity while Morecambe, when asked what he and Wise would have been if not comedians, replied"Mike and Bernie Winters".

The double act format can also be used in presenting noncomedic information in an entertaining manner, such as Savage/Hyneman pair of the Discovery Channel's MythBusters. From 2006 to 2010, Apple used the double-act formula successfully in its popular series of I'm a Mac/And I'm a PC ads with John Hodgman and Justin Long.

Another famous double act duo is Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox or better known as, Smosh
In pro wrestling



Question: What is the stage name of double act 'Ian and Janet Tough?'
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the stage name of the double act "Ian and Janet Tough." Let me start by reading the context provided. 

The context talks about double acts in comedy, mentioning several examples like Morecambe and Wise, The Two Ronnies, and others. It also mentions that sometimes the stage names can be less obvious, like in the case of Fry and Laurie or Lee and Herring. 

The question is specifically about the stage name of the double act "Ian and Janet Tough." I don't recall this exact name from the context provided. The context does mention several British acts, but not this particular one. 

Wait, maybe I should think about how stage names are usually structured. Often, they're either a play on words or a combination of names. The names Ian and Janet Tough sound like they could be a duo, perhaps with a twist. 

Looking back, the context mentions that sometimes the roles aren't as obvious, like in the case of Fry and Laurie, where one is the straight man and the other the comic. But I don't see any direct mention of "Ian and Janet Tough" in the provided text. 

Hmm, perhaps the stage name is a play on words. "Tough" could be part of their personas, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe their stage names are just variations of their real names, but that doesn't seem to fit here. 

Wait, the context does mention that sometimes the roles are less obvious, but I don't see any specific examples beyond what's already given. Since the question is about their stage name, and the context doesn't provide it, I might have to infer or realize that it's not directly mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the stage name is a combination of their real names, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The question is specifically about "Ian and Janet Tough," so perhaps the stage name is just "Ian and Janet Tough," but that seems too straightforward.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Black Caps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team.  Official New Zealand Cricket sources typeset the nickname as BLACKCAPS. This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks.

As of February 2016, New Zealand have played 408 Test matches, winning 83, losing 165 and drawing 160.

The New Zealand cricket team, nicknamed the Black Caps, are the national cricket team representing New Zealand. They played their first  in 1930 against England in Christchurch, New Zealand, becoming the fifth country to play Test cricket. It took the team until 1955‚Äì56 to win a Test, against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland.  They played their first ODI in the 1972‚Äì73 season against Pakistan in Christchurch.

As of 4 May 2016, the New Zealand cricket team is ranked 5th in Tests, 2nd in ODIs and 1st in T20Is by the ICC.
New Zealand reached the final match in the ICC Cricket World Cup for the first time in its history, after beating South Africa in the semi-final in 2015. 

History

Beginnings of cricket in New Zealand

In early 2015 New Zealand made the final of the Cricket World Cup, going through the tournament undefeated until the final, where they lost to Australia by seven wickets. 

In 2015 the New Zealand national cricket team played under the name of Aotearoa for their first match against Zimbabwe to celebrate MƒÅori Language Week.  j

In mid-2015 New Zealand toured England,  performing well, drawing the Test series 1-1, and losing the One Day series, 2‚Äì3.

New Zealand played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951‚Äì52, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56.

In 1954/55 New Zealand recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years to attain.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "Walk On By" is a song composed by Burt Bacharach, with lyrics by Hal David. The song was originally recorded in 1964 by Dionne Warwick, who charted at number 6 with her version on the Billboard Hot 100. Isaac Hayes covered the song in 1969 and reached number 30 on the Hot 100 chart and number 13 in the R&B charts  with his version. "Walk On By" has since charted numerous times in various countries, with wildly different arrangements. The following entries discuss the chart versions of the song,in the order in which they appeared.Dionne Warwick version

Background

The original version of "Walk On By" by Dionne Warwick was recorded at the same December 1963 session that yielded her hit "Anyone Who Had a Heart". "Walk On By" was the follow-up to that single, released in April 1964 and reaching number 6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Cashboxs R&B chart.  (Billboard did not print rhythm and blues charts during 1964, the year of the song's peak performance.) The song also reached the top 10 in a brief run on Billboard's easy listeningsurvey. The song was ranked number 70 on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Warwick also recorded a German version of the song, entitled "Geh Vorbei". 

Chart performance

Bobby Kris & The Imperials version

The Toronto folk-rock group Bobby Kris & The Imperials released a fairly straight-ahead cover version in late 1965.  The single became a major hit in Canada, reaching number 8 in early 1966, but "Walk On By" was to be the band's only hit.

Chart performance

Isaac Hayes version

Funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes released a cover version of "Walk on By" in 1969 for  his studio album Hot Buttered Soul and transformed the song into a twelve-and-a-half minute funk vamp. Edited for single release down to under 5 minutes, this single reached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. This version was also featured in the film Dead Presidents and is sampled in R&B singer Beyonc√©'s 2016 song "6 Inch".

Chart performance

The Stranglers version

In 1990, singer Sybil, who had scored her biggest hit a year prior with a cover of Warwick's "Don't Make Me Over," also scored a U.S. and UK hit with "Walk On By."

Chart performance

Gabrielle version

In 1997, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of "Walk on By" as the fifth and final single from her studio album, Gabrielle. It reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart.

Cyndi Lauper version



Question: Who's chart hit 'Walk tall' Started his career in 1964? 

Wait, the question is about a chart hit called "Walk tall" and who started his career in 1964. But in the context, the song is "Walk On By", not "Walk tall". So perhaps the question is a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "Walk On By".

Assuming that, the question is: Who's chart hit 'Walk On By' started his career in 1964?

Looking at the context, the first chart hit was Dionne Warwick's version in 1964. But the question is about someone starting his career in 1964. The next version was Bobby Kris & The Imperials in 1965, then Isaac Hayes in 1969, Sybil in 1990, Gabrielle in 1997.

Wait, but the question is about someone whose chart hit started his career in 1964. So perhaps the first artist, Dionne Warwick, started her career in 1964? Or maybe the question is about someone else.

Wait, the context says that Dionne Warwick's version was recorded in 1963, released in 1964, and she had hits around then. So her career was already established before 1964. So perhaps the question is about someone else.

Wait, the question is about a chart hit called "Walk tall" but the context is about "Walk On By". Maybe it's a typo. So perhaps the correct song is "Walk On By".

So, the question is: Who's chart hit 'Walk On By' started his career in 1964?

Looking at the context, the first version was Dionne Warwick in 1964, but she was already established. The next was Bobby Kris & The Imperials in 1965, so their hit was in 1965. Then Isaac Hayes in 1969. So none of them started their career in 1964.

Wait, perhaps the question is about someone else. Maybe the question is about the artist who started his career in 1964 with a chart hit of "Walk On By". But in the context, the first version was Dionne Warwick in 1964, but she was already a known artist. The next was Bobby Kris & The Imperials in 1965, so their hit was in 1965, but their career started in 1965.

Wait, the question is: Who's chart hit 'Walk tall' Started his career in 1964?

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Louisville is home to many annual cultural events. Perhaps most well-known is the Kentucky Derby, held annually during the first Saturday of May. The Derby is preceded by a two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival, which starts with the annual Thunder Over Louisville, the largest annual fireworks display in North America.  The Kentucky Derby Festival also features notable events such as the Pegasus Parade, The Great Steamboat Race, Great Balloon Race, a combined marathon/mini marathon and aboutseventy events in total. Esquire magazine has called the Kentucky Derby "the biggest party in the south."

Louisville (pronounced, or) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the 30th-most populous city in the United States. It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington. Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County.

Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a 6000 mi system across 13 states. Today, the city is known

The Louisville market has ranked first in ratings for the NCAA men's basketball tournament every year since 1999.  The Kentucky Wildcats used to play an annual game in Freedom Hall.

Usually beginning in late February or early March is the Humana Festival of New American Plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville, an internationally acclaimed new-play festival that lasts approximately six weeks.

On Memorial Day weekend, Louisville hosts the largest annual Beatles Festival in the world, Abbey Road on the River. The festival lasts five days and is located on the Belvedere in downtown Louisville.

Question: Name the year: The Macintosh is introduced, Louisiana hosted the last World‚Äôs Fair to be held in the US, Vanessa Williams resigns her Miss America crown, Band Aid records the song ‚ÄúDo They Know It‚Äôs Christmas‚Äù for famine relief, Union Carbide wipes out a good chunk of Bhopal, India, with a chemical spill, and the first Super Bowl is played.
</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the year when several events happened. The events are: The Macintosh is introduced, Louisiana hosted the last World‚Äôs Fair to be held in the US, Vanessa Williams resigns her Miss America crown, Band Aid records the song ‚ÄúDo They Know It‚Äôs Christmas‚Äù for famine relief, Union Carbide wipes out a good chunk of Bhopal, India, with a chemical spill, and the first Super Bowl is played.

First, I'll break down each event and try to recall or figure out the year they occurred.

1. The Macintosh is introduced. I know that Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984. That's a big one, and I remember it was a significant product launch.

2. Louisiana hosted the last World‚Äôs Fair to be held in the US. I'm not exactly sure when World's Fairs started, but I think they were common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last one in the US was probably in the early 1980s. I think it was in the 1984 World's Fair, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check that.

3. Vanessa Williams resigns her Miss America crown. I remember Vanessa Williams was the first African American Miss America, and she won in 1983. She resigned in 1985 due to a controversy. So that would be 1985.

4. Band Aid records the song ‚ÄúDo They Know It‚Äôs Christmas‚Äù for famine relief. I think this was a Christmas single released around the holiday season. I believe it was in 1984 or 1985. Wait, I think it was 1984 because the famine in Ethiopia was in the mid-80s, and the song was a big hit around that time.

5. Union Carbide wipes out a good chunk of Bhopal, India, with a chemical spill. I recall the Bhopal disaster happened in 1984. It was a major industrial accident involving methyl isocyanate gas, causing massive damage.

6. The first Super Bowl is played. The first Super Bowl was Super Bowl I, which was held on January 29, 1967. That's when the Green Bay Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs.

Now, putting it all together:

- The Macintosh: 1984
- Louisiana World's Fair: 1984
- Vanessa Williams resigned in 1985
- Band Aid's song: 1984
- Bhopal disaster: 1984
- First Super Bowl: 1967

Wait, but the question is asking for the year when all these events happened. However, the events happened in different years. The question might be asking for the year when all these events occurred, but they happened in different years. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the year when ['1984', 'one thousand nine hundred and eighty four']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: In the "America's Top Colleges" rankings by Forbes in 2016, Princeton University was ranked third among all national colleges and universities, after holding the number one position for a number of years. 

In the 2015 U.S. News & World Report "Graduate School Rankings", all thirteen of Princeton's doctoral programs evaluated were ranked in their respective top 20, 8 of them in the top 5, and 4 of them in the top spot (Economics, History, Mathematics, Sociology).

From 2001 to 2016, Princeton University was ranked either first or second among national universities by U.S. News & World Report (USNWR), holding the top spot for 14 of those 16 years  (sole #1 nine times, #1 tied with Harvard five times). Princeton was ranked first in the most recent 2016 U.S. News rankings, as well as #1 in the 2015 and 2016 rankings for "best undergraduate teaching." In the 2014‚Äì15 Times Higher Education assessment of the world's greatest universities, Princeton was ranked7th.  In the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings,  it was ranked 9th overall in the world and 5th among US universities.

In Princeton Reviews rankings of "softer" aspects of students' college experience, Princeton University was ranked first in "Students Happy with Financial Aid" and third in "Happiest Students", behind Clemson and Brown. 

Princeton was ranked the 360th top college in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index college rankings.

Princeton University  is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.  Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  College of New Jersey, Princeton was the fourth chartered institution of higher education in the Thirteen Colonies  and thus one of the nine colonial colleges established before the American Revolution. The institution moved to Newark in 1747, then to the current site nine years later, where it was renamed Princeton University in 1896.

would institute an early action program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016.  In 2011, The Business Journal rated Princeton as the most selective college in the Eastern United States in terms of admission selectivity.



Question: The Princeton Review just released their list of the top 371 colleges and universities in the US. What Big Ten school was Ranked the #1 party school? 

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "The Princeton Review just released their list of the top 371 colleges and universities in the US. What Big Ten school was ranked the #1 party school?"

First, I'll look through the provided context to find any mention of Princeton University's rankings related to party schools or similar. 

In the context, there's a mention of Princeton University being ranked in various categories by Princeton Reviews. Specifically, it says: "In Princeton Reviews rankings of 'softer' aspects of students' college experience, Princeton University was ranked first in 'Students Happy with Financial Aid' and third in 'Happiest Students', behind Clemson and Brown."

Wait, that's about happiness and financial aid, not party schools. So that doesn't directly answer the question about party schools.

Another part mentions that Princeton was ranked the 360th top college by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index. Again, that's about different rankings, not party schools.

Looking further, the context also talks about Princeton's rankings in U.S. News & World Report and other surveys, but nothing specifically about party schools.

Wait, the question is about the Princeton Review's list of top 371 colleges and universities, specifically asking which Big Ten school was ranked #1 party school. 

In the context, the only mention of Princeton Review is about their rankings in 'Students Happy with Financial Aid' and 'Happiest Students', not party schools. So perhaps the context doesn't directly provide the information needed.

But wait, the context does mention that Princeton was ranked the most selective college in the Eastern US by The Business Journal in 2011. That's about selectivity, not partying.

Hmm, maybe I need to infer. The question is about a Princeton Review ranking, but the context only mentions Princeton's rankings in other areas. So perhaps the answer isn't directly provided in the context, but maybe I can think of other Big Ten schools known for parties.

Wait, the context doesn't mention any party rankings, so perhaps the answer isn't in the context. But the question is prompting me to answer based on the context provided. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the context says that in Princeton Reviews rankings, Princeton was first in 'Students Happy with Financial Aid' and third in 'Happiest Students'. But the question is about party schools. So perhaps the context doesn't have the info, but maybe I can think of the Princeton Review's party school rankings.

Wait, the context doesn't mention party schools, so perhaps the answer isn't there. But the question is based on the context, so maybe the answer isn't provided. But the user is asking me to answer based on the context, so perhaps I should say that the context doesn't specify.

Wait, no, the question is asking what Big Ten school was ranked #1 party school by Princeton Review, but the context only mentions Princeton's rankings ['rock ethics institute', 'penn state state college', 'ist building', 'center for medieval studies pennsylvania state university', 'pennsylvania state university university park', 'penn state university park', 'university park centre county pennsylvania', 'ist building penn state', 'penn state', 'pennsylvania state university', 'pennstate', 'upua', 'state penn', 'pennsylvania state college', 'pennsylvania agricultural college', 'university park pa', 'penn state fight song', 'lion ambassadors', 'psu edu', 'dreamers of phi mu alpha', 'willard building', 'penn state college of health and human development', 'pennsylvania state univ', 'penn state university police', 'pennsylvania state university Rankings', 'penn state university', 'universidad estatal de pensilvania', 'penn state univerisity', 'penn st']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up.  In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes  and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in

Overview

In stand-up comedy, the feedback of the audience is instant and crucial for the comedian's act. Audiences expect a stand-up comic to provide a steady stream of laughs, and a performer is always under pressure to deliver. Comedic actor Will Ferrell has called stand-up comedy "hard, lonely, and vicious".

revived careers late in life. Television programs such as Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show helped publicize the careers of other stand-up comedians, including Janeane Garofalo, Bill Maher and Jay Leno.

Stand-up comedy is the focus of four major international festivals: the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland; Just for Laughs in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; HBO's U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, CO, and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in Melbourne, Australia. A number of other festivals operate around the world, including The Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, the Vancouver Comedy Festival, the New York Comedy Festival, the Boston Comedy and Film Festival, the New York

In 1979, the first American-style stand-up comedy club, the Comedy Store, London was opened in London by Peter Rosengard, where many alternative comedy stars of the 1980s, such as Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Alexei Sayle, Craig Ferguson, Rik Mayall, and Ade Edmondson began their careers.  The stand-up comedy circuit rapidly expanded from London across the UK. The present British stand-up comedy circuit arose from the 'alternative' comedy revolution of the 1980s, with political and



Question: In addition to hosting the Academy Awards, what stand up comic took over for Craig Kilborn behind the desk of The Daily Show?

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "In addition to hosting the Academy Awards, what stand up comic took over for Craig Kilborn behind the desk of The Daily Show?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about a stand-up comedian who took over for Craig Kilborn on The Daily Show, and this person also hosts the Academy Awards. 

I know that Craig Kilborn was the host of The Daily Show for a while. I remember that he left the show, and someone else took over. I think that person was Jon Stewart. Wait, no, Jon Stewart was the original host of The Daily Show. Oh, right, after Jon Stewart left, someone else took over. I think it was Steve Carell? Or maybe someone else. Wait, no, Steve Carell is an actor and wasn't a host. 

Wait, no, I think it was John Oliver who took over after Craig Kilborn. But wait, John Oliver was already on The Daily Show before. Let me think. Craig Kilborn was the host, and then he was replaced by someone else. I think it was Jon Stewart again, but no, Stewart was the original host. Maybe it was someone else. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the timeline. The Daily Show started with Jon Stewart as the host. Then, after he left, he was succeeded by someone else. I think it was Steve Carell, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it was John Oliver. Wait, no, John Oliver was a correspondent before becoming the host. 

Wait, no, I think the person who took over after Craig Kilborn was actually John Oliver. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it was someone else. 

Wait, I'm mixing up the hosts. Let me try to recall. The Daily Show's hosts have been Jon Stewart, then after he left, it was John Oliver who took over. But wait, no, John Oliver was a correspondent, not the host. Wait, no, I think the host after Stewart was someone else. 

Wait, I think the person who took over after Stewart was not John Oliver. Maybe it was someone else. Alternatively, perhaps it was a different comedian. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the Academy Awards part. The question says the person also hosts the Academy Awards. I know that Jimmy Kimmel hosts the Oscars sometimes. But Jimmy Kimmel is a stand-up comedian. So, if the person hosts the Oscars, it's likely Jimmy Kimmel. 

Wait, but the question is about someone who took over for Craig Kilborn on The Daily Show. So, if Jimmy Kimmel took over for Craig Kilborn, but I don't think that's the case. 

Wait, no, I think the person who took over for Craig Kilborn was John Oliver. But I'm not sure.

</think><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: "On Monday, Samoa became the first nation in nearly 40 years to switch sides of the road. On what side do they now drive?" 

First, I'll break down the information given. Samoa recently switched sides of the road, and this hasn't happened in about 40 years. The question is asking which side they now drive on.

I remember that most countries have either left-hand traffic or right-hand traffic. In the United States, for example, they drive on the right, and in the UK, they drive on the left. So, when a country switches sides, it's moving from one to the other.

From the context provided, I see that Samoa is mentioned in relation to the USA and New Zealand. Specifically, it says that Tutuila and Aunu'u islands became part of American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States. Also, Western Samoa (now Samoa) was under New Zealand forces after being captured from Germany in 1914.

I think that Samoa, before the switch, might have been driving on the left, similar to New Zealand, which is on the left side. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, actually, I recall that Samoa used to drive on the right, like the USA, but maybe they switched to the left. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, the question says they switched sides, so they must have changed from one to the other. If they switched, they must have been on the opposite side before. Let me think: if they switched to the left, they were previously on the right. Or if they switched to the right, they were on the left before.

But the question is about where they now drive. So, the answer is either left or right. I think Samoa was previously on the right, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, I think Samoa might have been on the left. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the context mentions that during the early 20th century, the Samoan Islands were partitioned by Germany, Great Britain, and the USA. Tutuila and Aunu'u became American Samoa, and the western islands became German Samoa, which later became Western Samoa under New Zealand. So, Western Samoa, which is now Samoa, was under New Zealand, which drives on the left. So, before the switch, Samoa was driving on the left, but they switched to the right? Or did they switch to the left?

Wait, the question says they switched sides, so they must have changed. If they were on the left before, they switched to the right. Or if they were on the right before, they switched to the left.

Wait, I think I remember that Samoa switched from right to left. No, wait, no, I think ['left album', 'left disambiguation', 'left']

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: ayatollah Kazem Seddiqi (⁄©ÿßÿ∏ŸÖ ÿµÿØ€åŸÇ€å in Persian, born 4 March 1951) is an Iranian scholar and Mujtahid currently serving as Tehran's Friday Prayer Temporary Imam. A rival of President Ahmadinejad, Seddiqi was appointed as interim Friday prayers leader for Tehran by Ayatollah Khamenei in August 2009. The New York Times characterized the appointment as part of an effort to "reinforce [Khamenei's] authority by cultivating divisions between factions" following the controversial June presidentialelection.

Among the targets of criticism in Seddiqi's khutbahs have been "certain regional countries for `supporting` the leader of the Jundallah terrorist group, Abdolmalek Rigi",  the United States President Barack Obama for showing his ‚Äúugly face‚Äù by preparing a new slate of sanctions against Iran,  and women who wear immodest clothing and behave promiscuously, which Seddiqi claims causes earthquakes to occur.   In response to the latter statement, hundreds of thousands of women around the world,

organized through social-networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, declared April 26, 2010, to be "Boobquake day", in which they all agreed to wear immodest clothing on the same day.

Constantine was born into a wealthy family; her father was successful in property and shipping sectors. She was privately educated as a child and went on to date British royalty, David, Viscount Linley, during the 1980s. Constantine has been involved in fashion for a long period, originally working in America for Giorgio Armani and then John Galliano in London. She met Trinny Woodall in 1994 who both proceeded to write a weekly fashion column, Ready to Wear. They founded Ready2shop.com, a

On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on Good Morning America and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women's shapes.  They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008.  Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5,000 women as of 2007.  With reference to their personal website, they state that their satisfaction remains with the many women they have helped and inspiredand not so much with the success of book sales and viewing figures.

Constantine and her family bought a 120 acre property in Sussex. Constantine is estimated to be worth ¬£5 million.

The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as "the one with 'big tits'."Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.

        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Panorama is a BBC Television current affairs documentary programme. First broadcast in 1953, it is the world's longest-running current affairs television programme.  Panorama has been presented by many well known BBC presenters, including Richard Dimbleby, Robin Day, David Dimbleby and Jeremy Vine. In 2014, it still retains a peak time transmission slot on BBC One, but without a regular presenter. The programme also airs worldwide through BBC World News on digital services, satellite and cablein many countries.

History

Panorama was launched on 11 November 1953 by the BBC; it emphasises investigative journalism. Daily Mail reporter Pat Murphy was the original presenter,  who only lasted one episode after accidentally broadcasting a technical mishap. Max Robertson then took over for a year. The programme originally had a magazine format and included arts features. Richard Dimbleby took over in 1955 and presented the show until his death in 1965.

His son, David Dimbleby, later presented the programme from 11 November 1974 ‚Äì the 21st anniversary of the show. Other past presenters include: Sir Robin Day, Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Sir Charles Wheeler and Jeremy Vine. On 13 December 2010, it was announced that the programme would be relaunched during the new year with no regular presenter.

International versions

on Monday evenings back to 9.30¬†pm, after the Nine O'Clock News.  Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yentob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9¬†pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10¬†pm, to make way for the sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticismthat it was side-lining serious content in favour of lighter programming.

Arguably the most famous Panorama programme of all was the 1995 interview of Diana, Princess of Wales by Martin Bashir, which occurred after her separation, when she openly discussed the rumours about her personal life. The programme's filming and planning was subject to extreme secrecy, with Richard James Ayre, the Controller of Editorial Policy, authorising a series of clandestine meetings between Bashir and Diana.

Question: The longest running television series ever, November 6, 1947 saw the debut of what now weekly news program, now hosted by David Gregory, following the unfortunante sudden death of host Tim Russert? 

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Question: The longest running television series ever, November 6, 1947 saw the debut of what now weekly news program, now hosted by David Gregory, following the unfortunante sudden death of host Tim Russert?

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

The question is about the longest running TV series. It says that on November 6, 1947, the debut of a weekly news program occurred. Now, this program is hosted by David Gregory, following the sudden death of host Tim Russert.

Wait, but the context given is about Panorama, which was launched in 1953, not 1947. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, the context says Panorama was launched on November 11, 1953. So the question is referring to a different program, perhaps.

Wait, the question is about the longest running TV series. The context is about Panorama, which is the longest running, starting in 1953.

But the question mentions November 6, 1947, which is earlier than 1953. So perhaps the question is referring to another program.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention any program starting in 1947. So maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about a weekly news program that was launched on November 6, 1947, and is now hosted by David Gregory after Tim Russert's death.

But in the context, the only program mentioned is Panorama, which started in 1953, hosted by various people including David Dimbleby, not David Gregory.

Wait, so perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps it's referring to a different program not mentioned in the context.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up facts. Let me think.

Wait, the context says Panorama was launched in 1953, and in 2014, it still airs, but without a regular presenter. It's the longest running current affairs program.

The question is about the longest running TV series, which would be Panorama, but the question refers to a program starting in 1947, which is earlier than Panorama's 1953.

So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps it's referring to a different program not in the context.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Panorama, but the dates don't match.

Wait, the question says the program was launched on November 6, 1947, and now hosted by David Gregory after Tim Russert's death.

But in the context, the program is Panorama, hosted by various people, including David Dimbleby, not David Gregory.

So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps it's a different program.

Wait, but the context doesn't mention any program starting in 1947. So perhaps ['mtp daily', 'meet press', 'meet press with tim russert', 'meet press with david gregory', 'meet depressed']

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described.  Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. A bony fish clade known as the lobe-finned fishes is included with tetrapods, which are further divided into amphibians, reptiles,

species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea snakes, penguins, cetaceans).

bony fishes have given rise to the land vertebrates; the traditional "amphibians" have given rise to the reptiles (traditionally including the synapsids, or mammal-like "reptiles"), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on phylogeny, organized by their known evolutionary history and sometimes disregarding the conventional interpretations of their anatomy and physiology.

mammals, and birds. Extant vertebrates range in size from the frog species Paedophryne amauensis, at as little as , to the blue whale, at up to 33 m. Vertebrates make up less than five percent of all described animal species; the rest are invertebrates, which lack vertebral columns.

In addition to these comes two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the Placodermi and the Acanthodii. Other ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the phylogeny on early amphibians and reptiles. An example based on Janvier (1981, 1997), Shu et al. (2003), and Benton (2004)  is given here:



Question: What's missing: Amphibians, Fish, Mammals, Reptiles, Invertebrates? The options are: A) Mammals, B) Fish, C) Reptiles, D) Invertebrates, E) Amphibians.

Okay, so I need to figure out what's missing from the list: Amphibians, Fish, Mammals, Reptiles, Invertebrates. The options are A) Mammals, B) Fish, C) Reptiles, D) Invertebrates, E) Amphibians.

Wait, the context says that the classes are tetrapods, which include amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. So, the list given is: amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles, invertebrates. But in the context, fish are part of the subphylum Vertebrata as well, but they are separate from tetrapods. So, the classes under tetrapods are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. So, the list in the question is: amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles, invertebrates.

Wait, but in the context, fish are part of the subphylum Vertebrata, but they are not tetrapods. So, the classes are: tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, mammals) and fish (bony and cartilaginous). So, the list in the question includes fish as a separate category, but the options don't include fish as the missing one. Wait, the options are A) Mammals, B) Fish, C) Reptiles, D) Invertebrates, E) Amphibians.

Wait, the question is asking what's missing from the list: Amphibians, Fish, Mammals, Reptiles, Invertebrates. So, the list includes five categories. The context says that the classes are tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, mammals) and fish (bony and cartilaginous). So, the list in the question includes fish as a separate category, but the options don't include fish as the missing one. Wait, the options are A) Mammals, B) Fish, C) Reptiles, D) Invertebrates, E) Amphibians.

        Now answer the following question using the provided context.
        <ÔΩúUserÔΩú>Context: "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. "The Twelve Days of Christmas" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived

"Twelve days of Christmas" was adapted from similar New Years' or spring French carols, of which at least three are known, all featuring a partridge, perdriz or perdriole, as the first gift. The pear tree appears in only the English version, but this could also indicate a French origin. According to Iona and Peter Opie, the red-legged (or French) partridge perches in trees more frequently than the native common (or grey) partridge and was not successfully introduced into England until about

The now-standard melody for the carol was published in 1909 by Novello & Co.. English composer Frederic Austin fitted the words to a traditional melody, to which he added his own two-bar motif for "Five gold rings".     Many of the decisions Austin made with regard to the lyrics subsequently became widespread:
* The initial "on" at the beginning of each verse.
* The use of "calling birds", rather than "colly birds", on the fourth day.
* The ordering of the final four verses.

Lyrics 

"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses. There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by "my true love" on one of the twelve days of Christmas.
There are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Austin's 1909 publication that first established the current form of the carol.   The first three verses run, in full, as follows:

In Scotland, early in the 19th century, the recitation began: "The king sent his lady on the first Yule day, | A popingo-aye [parrot]; | Wha learns my carol and carries it away?" The succeeding gifts were two partridges, three plovers, a goose that was grey, three starlings, three goldspinks, a bull that was brown, three ducks a-merry laying, three swans a-merry swimming, an Arabian baboon, three hinds a-merry hunting, three maids a-merry dancing, three stalks o' merry corn.
